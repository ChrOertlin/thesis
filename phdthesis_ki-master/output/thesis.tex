\section{Gene expression}\subsection{The central dogma of gene expression}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{.6\textwidth}
  \includegraphics{./figures/geneExprPath_2.pdf}
  \caption{The gene expression pathway - DNA is transcribed in pre-mRNA containing a 5' cap (black oval) introns (teal boxes),exons (purple boxes) and a poly(A) tail. RNAs are processed into mRNAs consisting out ouf a 5' cap, exons and a poly(A) tail. mRNAs can be transported out of the cellular nucleus into the cytoplasm where they can be degraded, stored or translated into proteins depending on cellular demands. Synthesised proteins can be degraded by proteosomes. \label{fig:geneExprPath}}
\end{wrapfigure}

The whole genetic code of an organisms is stored as deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA) molecules in a double stranded formation as highly condensed
chromosomes. Transcription is the process by which temporary copies of
the DNA are generated called transcripts or ribonucleic acid (RNA) that
occurs in the cell's core (nucleus). RNAs can undergo processing by
which multiple different variants coming from the same region are
produced. A subset of processed RNAs is the so called messenger RNA
(mRNA). These mRNAs are transported from the nucleus into the cytoplasm
where they can be stored, degraded or associate with ribosomes.
Ribosomes translate mRNAs in proteins that fulfil major functions within
the cell. Proteins themselves can also undergo degradation. (\textbf{see
figure \ref{fig:geneExprPath}}). This flow of genetic information into
expressed proteins is commonly referred to as the central dogma in
molecular biology (F. Crick, 1970). \clearpage
\subsection{Contribution to gene expression} Proteins are the last
product of the gene expression pathway and carry out the vast majority
of all cellular functions. While it is apparent that modulation of
protein levels will offer information on the changes in gene expression,
it cannot completely answer the question as to why the levels change. In
a disease context, protein levels alone might offer sufficient insight
to explain phenotypic differences. However, information on how these
differences arise mechanistically is obscured. Yet these differences in
underlying biological mechanisms can be used as targets in therapeutic
strategies

Experimental methods to measure gene expression at different steps are
often to referred as ``omics'' (e.g.~proteomics for protein expression,
transcriptomics for mRNA expression). These methods provide snapshots of
the step under scrutiny in a specific context (steady state or
perturbation) for a large portion of genes or proteins. Initially,
transcriptomics studies approached gene expression with the assumption
that mRNA expression is the main determinant for protein levels and
therefore could be used as a proxy for them. However, this view was
challenged by several landmark studies that observed a poor mRNA to
protein correlation and indicated a larger role of post transcriptional
regulation in gene expression than previously assumed (J. Lu, Tomfohr,
\& Kepler, 2005,Vogel \& Marcotte (2012),de Sousa Abreu, Penalva,
Marcotte, \& Vogel (2009),Schwanh√§usser et al. (2011),G. M. Silva \&
Vogel (2016)).

The debate regarding which step of the gene expression pathway
contributes most is ongoing, nevertheless an understanding has been
reached that the cellular context is a major determinant. At steady
state mRNA levels seem to explain protein abundance best, however in
perturbed systems the contribution of transcript abundance is shifted
away to other steps (Y. Liu, Beyer, \& Aebersold, 2016). For example in
a study that challenged immune cells, protein levels were dependent on
cellular transcript levels (Jovanovic et al., 2015). In contrast a study
investigating cells under stress observed extensive modulation at the
protein levels, whereas mRNA transcript abundance was only mildly
affected (Cheng et al., 2016).

While the contribution of different steps of the gene expression is
dependent on many different factors, e.g.~cellular state or treatments,
mRNA translation (synthesis of proteins) is an essential process of this
pathway. Furthermore, dysregulation of mRNA translation has been
observed in multiple diseases, ranging from neurological disorders to
cancer which warrants for a comprehensive understanding of this process
(Kapur \& Ackerman, 2018,Ruggero (2013),L. J. Lee et al. (2021),Graff et
al. (2009)). This thesis will focus on the role of mRNA translation in
gene expression in the context of cancer. \newline
\section{mRNA translation} \subsection{Overview of an mRNA} After
transcription, primary RNA transcripts are processed into mRNAs. mRNAs
contain a protein coding region which is flanked by untranslated regions
(5' and 3' UTRs) that exert translational control over the mRNA (see
\ref{regmRNA}). The 5' has a cap that is important for translation
initiation (Grifo, Tahara, Morgan, Shatkin, \& Merrick, 1983), while the
3' end has a poly-A tail protecting the mRNA against degradation
(Wilusz, Wormington, \& Peltz, 2001). Multiple different mRNAs (isoforms
or transcript variants) from the same genomic region exist. These
variants can arise due to a process called alternative splicing which
alters the exon composition (e.g.~coding region) of an mRNA. These
variants can co-exist at the same time and have distinct properties and
can perform distinct functions (Joly Anne-Laure et al., 2018).
Furthermore, splicing resulting in alternative UTRs for the same mRNA
can introduce to differences in translation (Jewer et al., 2020).

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{1\textwidth}
  \includegraphics{./figures/UTRFeatures.pdf}
  \caption{ An mRNA consists of a coding sequence (green), 5' (light orange) and 3' (purple) untranslated regions flanking the coding sequence, a 5' cap and a poly-A tail. Located within the 5' and 3' untranslated region are cis elements (light red boxes) that can exert translational control by interfering with ribosomal movement along the mRNA or interact with trans factors (blue and red) or recruit the 43s ribsome (dark green) to the mRNA (see section \ref{regmRNA}). The codon composition of the coding sequence influences translation elongation rates (see section \ref{tRNA}).   
 \label{fig:UTRFeat}}
\end{wrapfigure}

\clearpage
\subsection{Translation of an mRNA} For the vast majority of protein
coding mRNAs, eukaryotic mRNA translation occurs in the cytoplasm,
however a small subset of mRNAs is translated in the mitochondria
({\textbf{???}}). mRNA translation is a process that includes
initiation, elongation, termination and ribosome recycling and is an
essential process \textbf{see Figure \ref{fig:doodlemRNASteps}}. During
the initiation phase a ribosome will associate with the mRNA and starts
scanning along the mRNA for a start codon to begin synthesis of the
polypeptide chain by incorporating amino acids. Amino acids are
transferred to the ribosome by specialised RNAs called transfer RNAs
(tRNA) that can recognise the genetic code in the mRNA. The availability
of tRNAs as well as their modification can influence the rate of
elongation (see \ref{tRNA}). The order by which amino acids are
incorporated is dictated by the order of the codons of the open reading
frame (ORF). Redundancy in the codon availability allows that amino
acids are encoded by multiple codons, for example lysine is encoded by
AAA and AAG. Once the ribosome encounters a stop codon, translation will
terminate and the polypeptide chain will be released. The ribosome then
disassociates from the mRNA and can be recycled to engage translation of
the same or another mRNA. The following sections describe these
processes in more detail.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{1\textwidth}
  \includegraphics{./figures/doodleTranslation.pdf}
  \caption{mRNA translation initiation, elongation, termination and ribosome recycling steps - The ribosome binds to the mRNA and initiates scanning for a start codon. The elongation phase incorporates amino acids into a polypeptide chain (i.e. the protein product). Once the end of the coding sequence is detected, by recognition of stop codons, the ribosome terminates translation and releases the polypeptide chain. The ribosome can then be recycled to participate in the translation of another mRNA or reinitiate. \label{fig:doodlemRNASteps}}
\end{wrapfigure}

\clearpage

\subsection{Initiation} \label{initiation}

For the initiation to commence, in eukaryotes, two complexes are
required; the pre-initiation complex (PIC) and the eukaryotic initiation
factor 4F (eIF4F) complex. Both these complexes are governed by
signalling pathways that regulate their availability dependent on
cellular cues (\textbf{see section \ref{regmRNA}}). The PIC consists of
the methionyl-initiatior transfer RNA (met-tRNAi) in a ternary complex
(TC) with guanosine triphosphate (GTP) bound eIF2 (Asano, Clayton,
Shalev, \& Hinnebusch, 2000). eIF4F is the translation initation complex
containing three eIFs; eIF4E, the 5' cap binding protein, eIF4G a
scaffold protein and eIF4A and RNA helicase (Grifo et al.,
1983,Hinnebusch (2006)). eIF4F recruites the PIC to the 5' cap of the
mRNA after which scanning for a start codon (AUG) occurs. After AUG
recognition eIF2-GTP is hydrolyzed forming a stable 48S PIC. After
release of eIF2-GTP the 60S ribosomal subunit joins to form the 80S
ribosome and protein synthesis can start (\textbf{Figure
\ref{initiation}}).

\subsection{Elongation}

The 80S ribosome contains three sites important for decoding an mRNA;
the acceptor (A), peptidyl (P) and exit (E) sites. During elongation in
eukaryotes aminoacytelated tRNAs are delivered to the A-site in a
ternary complex with eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) and
Guanosine triphosphate (GTP). When the tRNA recognises its cognate codon
and pairs, a bond between the amino acid and the polypeptide chain is
formed. The formation of the bonds causes the ribosomal units to rotate
in relation to each other (Munro, Altman, O'Connor, \& Blanchard,
2007,Moazed \& Noller (1989)). The rotation causes a shift of the tRNA
acceptor end from the A and P to the P and E sites, whereas the codon
end remains in the A and P site. This is the ``hyrbid'' state of the
tRNAs in the ribosome(Dorner, Brunelle, Sharma, \& Green, 2006). eEF2
then promotes the translocation by which the codon end of the tRNA
follow into the P and E sites. The deacytelated tRNA is then released
from the ribosome. This process is repeated until a stop codon (UAA, UGA
or UAG) enters the A site of the ribosome(C. U. T. Hellen, 2018){]}.

mRNA translation termination is facilitated by two eukaryotic release
factors (eRF), eRF2 and eRF3-GTP(I. Stansfield et al., 1995,Alkalaeva,
Pisarev, Frolova, Kisselev, \& Pestova (2006)). A TC containing eRF2 and
eRF3-GTP binds to the A-site of the ribosome upon recognition of a stop
codon. This causes an ATP hydrolysis event resulting in a conformational
change and release of the polypeptide chain. eRF1 and the ATP binding
cassette protein (ABCE1) together promote the splitting of the 60S and
40S subunits after which they can be recycled(Pisarev et al., 2010,Dever
\& Green (2012),C. U. T. Hellen (2018)).

\subsection{Translation efficiency}

Each ribosome synthesises a single protein during translation of an mRNA
assuming it is not prematurely terminated. It has been known since the
'60s that translation of an mRNA occurs via multiple bound ribosomes
(polysomes) simultaneaously (\textbf{see figure
\ref{fig:polysomes}A-C})(Warner, Rich, \& Hall, 1962,Staehelin, Brinton,
Wettstein, \& Noll (1963)).Therefore the translation efficiency of an
mRNA depends on the number of ribosomes it is associated with. While all
steps of translation can affect the translation efficiency of an mRNA,
it is most commonly regulated at the initiation step(Richter \& Coller,
2015,Dever \& Green (2012),Jackson, Hellen, \& Pestova (2010)).

Experimental methods, e.g.~polysome profiling or by measuring ribosome
transit time are used to measure translation efficiencies. Furthermore,
there are efforts to model translation kinetics such as totally
asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP) to obtain a better
understanding of ribosome movements along the mRNA (MacDonald, Gibbs, \&
Pipkin, 1968,Maniloff (1969)) (\textbf{See figure
\ref{fig:polysomes}D}). A model that assessed ribosome traffic under
steady state and high initiation rates indicates traffic is not only
dependent on the densities of ribosomes but also codon specific
elongation rates and their distribution along the mRNA (Szavits-Nossan
\& Evans, 2020). The next section will go further into detail how mRNA
translation can be regulated so that initiation rates, but also
elongation, are influenced.

\section{Regulation of mRNA translation} \label{regmRNA}

mRNA translation is the most energy consuming process in the cell, for
example in rat it was estimated to account for \textasciitilde{}20\% of
the cellular energy consumption (Buttgereit \& Brand, 1995). The role of
mRNA translation in gene expression and high energy consumption
therefore translational control is paramount, especially in cancer where
deregulated metabolism is common(Hanahan \& Weinberg, 2011).

A strong feature of translational control of initiation rates or
elongation rates is that it can affect mRNA distinct populations
differently. When one or more components of the translation machinery
are affected (e.g.~initiation factors, ribosomal proteins, tRNA
availability) translation of a large set of mRNAs is affected
(i.e.~global regulation). Whereas translational control acting on
characteristics of mRNAs, e.g.~through cis elements in the UTRs or RNA
binding proteins (RBP), selective regulation occurs. In some cases mRNAs
escape global translational control.

Major signalling pathways, e.g.~the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and the
integrated stress response, regulate translation at a global level.
Furthermore, the codon usage of mRNAs can be used to regulate
translation globally dependent on the available tRNA pool or tRNA
modifications. Selective regulation of mRNA translation occurs via
characteristics a limited population of mRNA share found in the 5' and
3' UTRs of an mRNA (Leppek, Das, \& Barna, 2018) (\textbf{see figure
\ref{fig:UTRFeat}}).

\subsection{mTOR} \label{mTOR}

mTOR is a conserved Ser/Thr kinase and is found in two structurally and
functionally distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2 (Saxton \& Sabatini,
2017,Pearce et al. (2007)). In a growth promoting environment mTOR
switches cell metabolism to increased production of protein, lipids and
nucleotides, while suppressing catabolic pathways. mTORC2 promotes
survival via signalling through protein kinase A (AKT) (Sarbassov,
Guertin, Ali, \& Sabatini, 2005).

mTOR activity is modulated via growth factor signalling (i.e.~insulin
and insulin-like growth factor; IGF1) as well as cellular metabolism.
Growth factor signalling es mediated through the phosphoinositide
3-kinase (PI3K) / AKT and Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathways. Both these signalling pathways are involved in oncogenic
signalling and under investigation as therapeutic targets in
cancer(Hilger, Scheulen, \& Strumberg, 2002,J. Yang et al. (2019)). In
several cancers (e.g.~breast, lung, prostate and colon) the gene
encoding the p110\(\alpha\) subunit of PI3K is frequently mutated or
amplified (D. A. Levine et al., 2005,Samuels et al. (2004),J. W. Lee et
al. (2005)). The E545K mutation which leads to a reduced inhibition of
p85 at the p110\(\alpha\) subunit (W. Jiang et al., 2018). In
\textbf{study 3} we investigate oncogenic signalling via the PI3K
pathway activated by insulin and the role of mTOR in mediating the
resulting effects on gene expression in the MCF7 breast cancer cell line
that harbours the E545K mutation (Schneck et al., 2013). Furthermore,
hyperactivity of PI3K/AKT and Ras/MAPK signalling pathways has been
reported in multiple cancers and been linked anti- cancer therapy
resistance (P√≥pulo, Lopes, \& Soares, 2012,Tan \& Yu (2013), Salaroglio,
Mungo, Gazzano, Kopecka, \& Riganti (2019)). mTOR, as a downstream actor
of these pathways integrating their signals, has therefore become a
focus of anti cancer therapy by either targeting mTORC1 or using dual
inhibitors for PI3K and mTOR (Bhat et al., 2015).

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.6\textwidth}
  \includegraphics{./figures/mTORsignal.jpg}

 \label{fig:mtorsignal}}
\end{wrapfigure}

mTOR fulfills a central role in metabolic signalling where it integrates
amino acids availability, glucose and cellular oxygen levels to form an
appropriate response. For example, amino acid availability induces
relocalisation of mTOR into proximity of Rag GTPases leading to its
activation (Sancak et al., 2008). Furthermore, Glucose deprivation and
oxygen availability regulate mTOR activity via adenosine-mono-phosphate
kinase (AMPK) signalling. AMPK is activated when a shift in the cellular
AMP to adenosine-tri-phophate (ATP) ratio is sensed (M. J. Sanders,
Grondin, Hegarty, Snowden, \& Carling, 2007,Kimball (2006)). While
hypoxia, deprivation of oxygen, inhibits protein synthesis in normal
cells, in breast cancer protein synthesis was not inhibited during
hypoxia attributed to uncontrolled mTOR signalling (Connolly,
Braunstein, Formenti, \& Schneider, 2006).

Given the central of mTOR governing proliferation, growth and
metabolism, which are often deregulated in cancer, it is vital to
comprehensively understand mTORC1 signalling herein (Hanahan \&
Weinberg, 2011).

\subsubsection{Global regulation of translation via mTOR}

mTOR regulates mRNA translation mainly by mediating availability of
eIF4E by phosphorylating 4E binding proteins (4E-BPs)(A.-C. Gingras et
al., 1999). eIF4E is required for mRNA 5' cap binding and formation of
the mRNA translation eIF4F complex. Therefore, inhibition of mTOR leads
to a down regulation of cap dependent mRNA translation initiation. eIF4E
has overexpression is commonly found cancers and targetted using
4E-antisense oligonucleotides as anti-cancer therapy (D. S. Hong et al.,
2011). Other downstream targets of mTOR such as S6k which has been shown
to regulate components of the translation machinery, e.g.~by activation
of programmed cell death protein 4(PDCD4) which disrupts eIF4G-eIF4A
binding through competition(, Dorrello et al., 2006,A. G√∂ke et al.
(2002)).

\subsubsection{Selective or "mTOR sensitive" regulation of translation}

translation involves transcripts with a terminal oligo pyrimidine (TOP)
motif consisting of a C followed by a stretch of 4-15 pyrimidines
directly after the 5' cap show near complete dissociation from ribosomes
under conditions when mTOR is inhibited (Meyuhas, 2000,Yamashita et al.
(2008)). TOP mRNA are enriched for genes encoding for parts of the
translation machinery (Meyuhas, 2000,Thoreen et al. (2012)). Recent work
indicates the importance of La ribonucleoprotein domain family member 1
(LARP1) in regulation of TOPs. LARP1 is thought to bind to the 5' mRNA
cap of TOP mRNAs via its DM15 domain and represses translation by
obstructing eIF4E binding. mTORC1 physically interacts and
phosphorylates LARP1. When phophorylation occurs close to the DM15
domain of LARP1 the inhibitory effect on mRNA translation of TOP mRNAs
is abolished (Jia et al., 2021). Other instances of selective
translation are for mRNAs that lack the TOP motif, but show sensitivity
to mTOR activity. These mRNAs are, in addition to mTOR, dependent on
either availability of eIF4E or activity of eIF4A (\textbf{see
\ref{eif4a}}). mTOR-eIF4E sensitive mRNAs show extremely short 5' UTRs
and encode for metabolic functions(Gandin et al., 2016b).

\clearpage
\subsection{The integrated stress response} The integrated stress
response is a signalling pathway which can be activated through kinase
signalling originating from various stress signals. These kinases
include Protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) which
is activated by misfolded peptides in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER),
Heme regulated eIF2alpha kinase (HRI) which is activated during
oxidative stress, protein kinase R (PKR) which is activated in response
to certain viral infections and GCN2 which is activated when cells are
deprived of amino acids(Kapur, Monaghan, \& Ackerman, 2017,Guan et al.
(2017),Taniuchi, Miyake, Tsugawa, Oyadomari, \& Oyadomari (2016),Andreev
et al. (2015)). During the integrated stress response the alpha subunit
of eIF2 is phosphorylated. Upon eIF2alpha phosphorylation, eIF2 alpha
directly engages the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2beta and
prevents conversion of inactive eIF2-GDP to active eIF2-GTP needed for
met-tRNAi incorporation in the TC, therefore inhibiting translation by
reducing PIC availability (Sonenberg \& Hinnebusch, 2009) (\textbf{see
also figure \ref{fig:initiation}}).

\subsubsection{Global and selective regulation of translation via the ISR}

Global and selective regulation of translation via the ISR is, similar
to mTOR signalling, achieved at a global and selective mRNA level.
Phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha limits ternary complex availability,
therefore ribosome recruitment to the 5' cap is limited which results in
a reduction of translation initiation. While global translation is
reduced upon ISR, translation of a selective subset of mRNA with
upstream open reading frames (uORFs) is increased. A uORF is a reading
frame that originates in the 5' UTR of an mRNA upstream of which the AUG
precedes that of the coding sequence. uORFs are out of frame with the
main ORF and when translated lower the expression of the mORF(Kozak,
1984). Ribosome profiling studies indicate that 50\% of mammalian mRNAs
harbour uORFs including oncogenes and transcripts important in
differentiation and cell cycle (Calvo, Pagliarini, \& Mootha,
2009,Ingolia, Lareau, \& Weissman (2011),D. R. Morris (1995)). The
surrounding context of the uORF is important for its inhibitory effect
through more efficient initiation, where the classical Kozak context
(i.e. {[}A,G{]}..\textbf{ATG}G) is most efficient(Kozak, 1986,Calvo et
al. (2009)). ATF4, a transcription factor for stress response genes,
contains two uORFs of which one partially overlaps with the mORF. Under
normal conditions ATF4 mRNA translation is initiated at uORF1 and
reinitiation at uORF2 occurs. The close proximity of uORF2 to the mORF
causes ribosomes to scan past the mORF start thereby inhibiting the
translation of the coding sequence. Limitation of TC availability during
ISR causes longer ribosome scanning times leading to that ribosomes scan
past uORF2 and initiate at the mORF(Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016).

\subsection{Regulation of mRNA translation by tRNAs} \label{tRNA}

As touched upon earlier, tRNAs are an essential part of the translation
machinery that carry the amino acids, to be incorporated into the
polypeptide chain during the elongation process, to the ribosome. tRNAs
consist of a 76-90 long nucleotide sequence set into a ``cloverleaf''
structure forming several loops (Sharp, Schaack, Cooley, Burke, \& Soil,
1985) (** see figure tRNA**). The acceptor stem binds the amino acid
carried by the tRNA, while the anti-codon loop binds to the mRNA within
the ribosome via classical watson-crick pairing (Watson \& Crick, 1953).
Multiple codons can encode for the same amino acid (synonymous codons),
however the availability of the tRNAs for different codons may vary
which can influence elongation rates.

This supply ( i.e.~tRNA availability) and demand (i.e.~codon in
expressed mRNA transcripts) relationship has been found to vary across
different cellular states, e.g.~proliferation and differentiation. In
this model two distinct subsets of tRNAs are observed; A tRNA subset
induced under proliferation that is otherwise repressed and a subset
with similar regulation under differentiation of which the supply
matches the codon demand of the transcriptome (Gingold et al., 2014).
Therefore, in this model differentiation and proliferation would
underlie two distinct translational programs dependent on tRNA
expression. This model has been disputed and that the observed
differences would be attributed to GC content in the mRNA (Rudolph et
al., 2016). Nevertheless, abbarent tRNA expression and codon usage have
been reported in cancer(Z. Zhang et al., 2018). Furthermore, a
comprehensive study including small RNAseq (i.e.~for identification of
tRNAs) and protein samples across 17 tissues obtained from the The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) reported a tRNA signature stratified by Ki67
(a proliferation marker) staining with implications for patient
survival(Hernandez-Alias, Benisty, Schaefer, \& Serrano, 2020).
Therefore, while a consensus on proliferation specific tRNA subsets
might not have been reached, emerging evidence implicates a role thereof
in cancer(Hernandez-Alias et al., 2020,Gingold et al. (2014),Z. Zhang et
al. (2018)).

Other reports of translational interference by tRNAs in cancer are
attributed to tRNA modifications, specifically at the U34 anti- codon
(or wobble) position which is highly conserved (Rapino, Delaunay, Zhou,
Chariot, \& Close, 2017,El Yacoubi, Bailly, \& de Cr√©cy-Lagard (2012)).
Wobbling was proposed by Francis Crick and refers to the ability of
non-watson-crick base pairing of tRNA anti codons(F. H. Crick, 1966).
This enables a smaller set of tRNAs (41-55 in eukaryotes) to encode for
the 64 possible codon combinations (Goodenbour \& Pan, 2006). In
mammals, the U34 modification catalytic cascade involves the
acetyltransferase Elongator (ELP3), the methyltransferase TRM9-like
domain of Alkylation repair homolog 8 (ALKBH8), and the urmylation (URM)
pathway, that includes the cytosolic thiouridylase homolog 1 and 2
(CTU1/CTU2)(Kalhor \& Clarke, 2003,Karlsborn et al. (2014)). These
enzymes ultimately modify the U34 modification into
5-methoxycarbonyl-methyl-2-thiouridine (\(mcm^5s^2U\)) which ensures
cognate codon recognition. This modification is thought to occur for a
small subset of tRNAs, namely \(tRNA^{UUU}\), \(tRNA^{UUC}\),
\(tRNA^{UUG}\), \(tRNA^{UCC}\), and \(tRNA^{UCU}\).

Loss of the ability to modify U34 has been shown to reduce translation
elongation rates with varying effects on protein expression (Nedialkova
\& Leidel, 2015,Deng et al. (2015),Zinshteyn \& Gilbert (2013)). While
in some cases U34 dependent signalling led to ribosome stalling
resulting in protein aggregates and increased stress (Nedialkova \&
Leidel, 2015,Zinshteyn \& Gilbert (2013)). Other reported a subtle
dowregulation of proteins encoded by mRNAs requiring U34-modified tRNAs
(Deng et al., 2015). U34 modification dependent tRNAs have been shown to
play a role in cancer. For example, ELP3 is important in tumor
initiation in the intestine and promotes breast cancer invasion as well
as progression to metastasis(Ladang et al., 2015,Delaunay et al.
(2016)). Furthermore, loss of U34 modification in a prostate cancer
model lead to an adaptive transcriptional response for mRNAs whose
translation was dependent on the U34 modification (Lorent et al., 2019).

\subsection{eIF4A sensitive mRNAs} \label{eif4a}

Progression of the ribosome through the 5' UTR is dependent on eIF4A,
the RNA helicase in the eIF4F complex, that unwinds structural elements
the ribsome encounters(Wolfe et al., 2014,Rubio et al. (2014)). The
importance of eIF4A's unwinding capacity was identified by treatment of
KOPT-K1 cells, a lymphoma cell line, MDA-MB-231 ,a breast cancer cell
line, with silvesterol of which translational control was evaluated
using ribosome profiling (\textbf{see section \ref{riboseq}})(Wolfe et
al., 2014,Rubio et al. (2014)). These studies identified silvesterol
sensitive mRNAs that are characterised by long and structured 5' UTRs.
In addition eIF4A dependent mRNAs were enriched for having multiple 5'
UTR variants, while independent mRNAs were not (Rubio et al., 2014).
Among eIF4A dependent mRNAs are genes important for proliferation and
survival which has implications for oncogenic signaling(Wolfe et al.,
2014,Gandin et al. (2016b)). Among others, these studies indicate a
strong therapeutic value in targeting ``sensitive mRNAs'' in diseases.
In \textbf{study 2} we aimed to exploit eIF4A sensitive mRNA translation
as a therapeutic strategy in pancreatic cancer.

\subsection{RNA binding proteins and trans-acting factors}

The UTRs of an mRNA contain sequence elements to which RNA and RNA
binding proteins (RBPs) bind and exert translational regulation. For
instance, MicroRNAs, a small class of non coding RNA, can directly bind
to other RNAs and silence them accomplished through translational
repression or, more often, destabilisation {[}Jonas2015{]}. RBPs are a
class of proteins involved in many regulatory steps of gene expression
and account for \textasciitilde{} 7.5\% of the protein coding genes.
Poly-A-binding-protein (PABP) is thought to form a closed loop complex
of the 3' end to the 5' by interacting with eIF4G. This closed loop
should promote translation and prevent mRNA decay (Afonina, Myasnikov,
Shirokov, Klaholz, \& Spirin, 2014,Amrani, Ghosh, Mangus, \& Jacobson
(2008)) (\textbf{see also figure \ref{fig:initiation}}). An RBP of
particular interest in \textbf{study 3} is Human antigen R (HuR). HuR
preferentially binds to AU-rich sequences in the 3' UTR and acts as a
stabilizing agent and is involved in RNA-processing (T. D. Levine, Gao,
King, Andrews, \& Keene, 1993,Baou, Norton, \& Murphy (2011),X. C. Fan
\& Steitz (1998),S. S.-Y. Peng, Chen, Xu, \& Shyu (1998)). Studies in
breast, colon and lung cancer observed correlation between HuR and
malignancy. Among HuR targets are HIF-1, VEGF (important for
angiogenesis) and the oncogene Myc (Denkert et al., 2004,L√≥pez de
Silanes et al. (2003),L√≥pez de Silanes, Lal, \& Gorospe (2005)).

\section{Expertimental methods to measure mRNA translation} \label{exptMethod}\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.6\textwidth}
    \includegraphics{./figures/polyRibo.pdf}
  \caption{Polysome profiling and ribosome profiling workflows. In polysome profiling a fraction from whole cytoplasmic RNA is loaded onto a sucrose gradient on which they get separated by sedimentation using ultra centrifugation. Fractions corresponding to efficiently translated mRNAs are collected and can be quantified with for example RNA sequencing (left). During ribosome profiling a fraction from the whole cytoplasmic RNA is exposed to a digestion agent which disturbs the RNA. The ribosomes will protect fragments thereby creating ribosome protected fragments. These fragments are then isolated and can be sequenced.  \label{fig:polyRibo}}
\end{wrapfigure}

Methods that measure mRNA translation try to capture the number of
ribosomes an mRNA is associated with on the prinicple that this is
directly correlated with their translation efficiency. There are two
methods that are predominantly used for measuring mRNA translation, or
changes in translation efficiencies across conditions, namely polysome
profiling and ribosome profiling (\textbf{see figure
\ref{fig:polyRibo}}).

\clearpage

\subsection{Polysome profiling}

is a technique to measure changes in translational efficiencies of mRNAs
between two or more conditions. Polysome profiling allows for separation
of polysomes from monosomes, ribosomal subunits and messenger
ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs). During the assay, ribosomes are
immobilized on the mRNAs using translation elongation inhibitors
(e.g.~cycloheximide). A portion of cytoplasmic RNA extracts then
sediment on a linear sucrose gradient (5-50\%) using ultra
centrifugation.

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.6\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{./figures/polysome_shifts.pdf}
  \caption{Polysome profliles -  (top left) Schematic representation of a polysome profile using linear sucrose gradient fractionation. Indicated in the polysome profiles are the 40S, 60S ribosomal subunits as well as the 80S monosome. H.P. indicates heavy polysome fractions.Between conditions (i.e. black an pink lines) distribution changes for mRNA abundance (grey and green; top right), translation (grey and red; bottom left) and translation within high polysome fractions (grey and red; bottom right) are illustrated. \label{fig:polysome}}
\end{wrapfigure}

The resulting gradient is fractionated and mRNAs with different number
of bound ribosomes can be extracted and analyzed for changes in
translational efficiency (Gandin et al., 2014). An illustration of a
polysome profile with peaks for the 40S, 60S subunits and 80S ribosome
can be seen in (\textbf{Fig \ref{fig:polysome} top left}). Subsequent
peaks along the frations indicate the mRNAs with 1 or more bound
ribosome. mRNAs are typically normally distributed along the fractions,
i.e.~a pool of the same mRNA will be associated with 1- n number of
ribosomes. Changes in mRNA abundance will lead to an overall increase in
the amount of isolated polysome-associated mRNA without a shift of the
distribution along the fractions (\textbf{Fig \ref{fig:polysome} top
right}). This means that the translation efficiency per mRNA remains
unchanged. Changes in translational efficiency can be observed by shifts
of polysome association for mRNAs from the light (inefficiently
translated) towards the heavy (efficiently translated) polysome
fractions or vice versa (\textbf{Fig \ref{fig:polysome} bottom left}).
Shift within the heavy polysome fractions (i.e.~3 bound ribosome to 7
bound ribosome) can also occur (\textbf{Fig \ref{fig:polysome} bottom
right}). These shift remain undetected in cases where the distribution
of polysome-associated mRNAs does not sufficiently shift across the
fractions and is a limitation of polysome profiling. Quantification of
mRNA levels within each fraction can be assessed using Northern blotting
or reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction
(RT-qPCR).

For transcriptome wide studies, pooling of efficiently translated mRNAs
(mRNAs with \textgreater{}3 bound ribosomes) followed by quantification
using either DNA-microarrays or RNA sequencing is common. The 3-ribosome
cut off has been chosen as it is thought to capture most biologically
relevant changes in translation efficiency. Pooling of mRNAs as well as
collection of multiple fractions makes polysome profiling inconvenient
when dealing with large samples sizes or experiments with low amounts of
input RNA. Therefore, an optimized sucrose gradient was developed where
most efficiently translated mRNAs are collected on a sucrose cushion and
thereby can be isolated from one single fraction (Liang et al., 2018).
This optimized gradient allows for application of polysome profiling in
small tissue samples where RNA quantity is limiting and reduces labor
intensity of the assay.

Polysome-associated mRNA levels are subject to changes in translation
efficiency as well as factors contributing to cytosolic mRNA levels.
Mechanisms such as transcription (i.e.~in the case of mRNA abundance) or
mRNA stability can affect cytosolic mRNA levels which impacts the pool
of mRNAs that can be associated to polysomes. Therefore, to identify
true changes in translation efficiency it is important to collect
cytoplasmic mRNA levels in parallel to polysome-associated mRNA to
correct for such mechanisms (e.g.~transcription or mRNA stability)
during downstream analysis (Gandin et al., 2014).

\subsection{Ribosome profiling} \label{riboseq}

Ribosome profiling is a technique that enables sequencing of ribosome
protected mRNA fragments (RPFs). In the assay ribosomes are immobilized
on the mRNAs using, similar to polysome profiling, translation
elongations inhibitors (e.g.~cyclohexamide) (Ingolia, Ghaemmaghami,
Newman, \& Weissman, 2009,Ingolia (2016)). One limitation with the use
of translation elongation inhibitors is the distortion of ribosome
distributions especially at translation initiation sites. These
introduced artefacts need to be accounted for in the downstream analysis
when assessing ribosome position along the mRNA. Following the
translation elongation inhibitor treatment, cells are immediately flash
frozen using liquid nitrogen. Alternatively, using only flash freezing
has been seen as a robust approach in a wide range of diverse organisms
(Brar \& Weissman, 2015).

RPFs are obtained by RNAse treatment that breaks the links of RNA
between ribosomes leaving single ribosomes with a \textasciitilde{}28
nucleotide long RNA fragment within each ribosome. The RPFs are then
isolated using ultra centrifugation through a sucrose cushion. During
this step other RNA fragments such as non-coding RNAs or large
ribonucleoprotein complexes can co-migrate and contaminate the sample.
Typically RPFs with a size ranging from 25-30 nucleotides are selected
for quantification.

In parallel to RPF selection, randomly fragmented total mRNA of the same
size is also retrieved. This is achieved by extraction of total mRNA
from cell lysate followed by purification via recovery of polyadenylated
messages or removal of ribosomal RNA. (Ingolia et al., 2009,Brar \&
Weissman (2015)).

\subsection{Comparing ribosome and polysome profiling}

Albeit both methods generate count data after quantification with
RNAsequencing, there are some key aspects that differ between the
techniques. Polysome profiling separates efficiently translated mRNAs
from non- efficiently translated mRNAs along a sucrose thereby creating
an mRNA based perspective for analyzing changes in translational
efficiencies. In contrast, ribosome profiling determines translational
efficiencies by counting the number of RPFs of both efficiently and
non-efficiently translated mRNAs. This gives polysome profiling the
advantage in cases of transcript variants with important features in
their 5¬¥UTR. Such information, if not protected by a ribosome, would be
lost in ribosome profiling.

Changes in translational efficiencies, e.g.~shifts between the polysomal
fractions, can be dramatic (I.e. near complete dissociation of ribosomes
from an mRNA) or subtle (shifts from 2 to 4 ribosomes) (Livingstone et
al., 2015). Ribosome profiling has been shown to be biased towards
identification of dramatic shifts of associated ribosomes to mRNAs,
whereas subtle shifts are masked which can lead to false biological
conclusions. Polysome profiling is affected by this to a much lesser
extent, thereby more robust in identifying such changes (Masvidal,
Hulea, Furic, Topisirovic, \& Larsson, 2017). Higher sensitivity in
detecting changes in translational efficiencies on a global scale makes
polysome profiling more suitable for genome-wide studies (Gandin et al.,
2016a).

An advantage of ribosome profiling is that it provides exact nucleotide
positions occupied by ribosomes. This offers information at a single
nucleotide level where the ribosome sits. Polysome profiling cannot
reveal ribosome locations along the mRNA. The single nucleotide
resolution of ribosome profiling is necessary in contexts studying local
translation events such as ribosomal frame shifts (Rato, Amirova, Bates,
Stansfield, \& Wallace, 2011) or uORF translation (Andreev et al.,
2015).

Both methods have their strengths and weaknesses and therefore each
method should be considered depending on the underlying biological
question of each experiment.

\section{Modes for regulation of gene expression through mRNA translation} \label{modes}

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.6\textwidth}
  \includegraphics{./figures/geneModes_MRNA.pdf}
  \caption{Regulatory modes of gene expression - Schematic representation of regulatory modes of translation efficiency in a fold-change scatter plot. Indicated in red are changes in translation (i.e. changes in translated mRNA but not total mRNA), in green changes in mRNA abundance (i.e. congruent changes between total mRNA and translated mRNA) and in blue translational buffering (i.e. changes in total mRNA levels but not translated mRNA levels). TE changes as the TE-score would estimate them are indicated.\label{fig:modes}}
\end{wrapfigure}

As explained in the previous section, from transcriptome-wide
assessments of translation using ribosome or polysome profiling
expression levels are obtained for both cytoplasmic and
polysome-associated mRNAs (or RPFs). For simplicity, from now on, these
RNA types will be referred to as total mRNA (i.e.~cytoplasmic mRNA) and
translated mRNA (i.e.~polysome-associated mRNA or RPFs). The estimation
of expression levels for both translated mRNA and total mRNA allows for
interrogation at two steps of the gene expression pathway and their
interaction. The interplay of total mRNA with translated mRNA can give
valuable insights about the underlying mechanisms that govern gene
expression in the studied system.

When comparing perturbed systems to their corresponding control state we
typically observe three ``modes'' in which translated mRNA and total
mRNA distinctly interact that impact gene expression (\textbf{See figure
\ref{modes}}). We refer to these modes as ``translation'', ``mRNA
abundance'' and ``translational buffering''.

\subsection{Translation}

A change in ``translation'' occurs when translated mRNA levels either
increase or decrease, however corresponding total mRNA levels remain
constant or change to a lesser extent resulting in a change of their
translation efficiency. A prominent example of this mode can be observed
to TOP mRNAs. These mRNAs, under conditions when mTOR is inhibited, show
a near complete dissassociation from ribosomes(Gandin et al., 2016b).
mRNAs under the translation mode are expected to reshape the proteome
(\textbf{See figure \ref{modes}}).

\subsection{mRNA Abundance}

Another mode that impacts the proteome is a change in mRNA abundance
here the translated mRNA level changes to a similar magnitude as the
total mRNA level. For these mRNAs the translation efficiency is
unaltered, as the change in total mRNA levels explains the change in
translated mRNA levels. Nevertheless, as there are more (or less) mRNAs
being translated an effect the proteome is expected. The underlying
biological implication for this mode mRNAs is often related to
transcription or mRNA stability (\textbf{See figure \ref{modes}}).

\subsection{Translational buffering} \label{modeBuffering}

In recent years, evidence emerged where translation efficiencies of
mRNAs can be altered to compensate for changes in total mRNA levels.
This mode is characterised by changes in total mRNA levels that are not
matched by translated mRNA levels. The expected result on the proteome
is that it maintaining (i.e.~keeping levels constant) rather than
reshaping it (McManus, May, Spealman, \& Shteyman, 2014,Lorent et al.
(2019)) (\textbf{See figure \ref{modes}}).

This mode was named ``Translational buffering'' and currently the
literature supports multiple different instances where translation
``buffers'' changes in transcription to retain a constant proteome. At
steady state, translation compensates for inter-individual,
inter-species or inter-tissue differences

At steady state a compensatory aspect of translational buffering is
observed when corrections are made, for e.g.~gene dosage or
transcriptional noise, at an inter-species or inter-individual level
(Artieri \& Fraser, 2014,C. Cenik et al. (2015),Perl et al. (2017),Z.-Y.
Wang et al. (2020),G.-W. Li, Burkhardt, Gross, \& Weissman
(2014),Lalanne et al. (2018)). Which is consistent that protein
abundance is overall more conserved across species (Laurent et al.,
2010).

An example of such compensation was observed when comparing evolutionary
distant bacteria species, i.e.~B. subtilis, E. coli and S. cerevisiae.
It was found that while extensive remodeling of promotors and
terminators diverged transcript abundance, post-transcriptional
regulation was altered to maintain a preferred stoichiometry of
pathways(Lalanne et al., 2018). In B. subtilis translation related
factors rpsP and rplS are transcriptionally fine tuned, whereas in E.
coli they lie within an operon together with rimM and trmD which are
only required in low abundance at the protein level. Therefore, E. coli
compensates the transcriptional input at the translational level(Lalanne
et al., 2018).

A different form of translational buffering can be observed at in
perturbed systems. For example, in prostate cancer cells a
transcriptional program was induced under estrogen receptor\(\alpha\)
(ER\(\alpha\)) depletion that was offset at the level of translation.
mRNAs whose transcription was induced required the tRNA u34
modification, of which the catalytic enzymes were dependent on
ER\(\alpha\), for efficient translation (Lorent et al., 2019). In
\textbf{study 3} we discuss the occurrence of translational buffering in
its ``offset'' context. \newline

\section{Algorithms for analysis of changes in translation efficiencies}\label{algorithm}

Given multiple roles of mRNA translation to regulate the proteome via
translation, mRNA abundance and buffering it is critical to distinguish
them as their underlying mechanisms can have different biological
implications. In this section we will discuss methods that analyse
polysome-profiling and ribosome profiling data to estimate changes in
translation efficiencies across 2 or more conditions and how these
methods identify different modes of gene expression.

Initially analysis of transcriptome-wide translation studies used an
approach called the translation efficiency (TE-score) that uses the
following equation:
\[\varDelta TE = \frac{\frac{P_{c2}}{T_{c2}}} {\frac{P_{c1}}{T_{c1}}}\\\]

This score calculates the ratio of the ratios between
polysome-associated mRNA levels (P) divided by total mRNA levels (T)
within each condition (i.e.~C1 and C2).

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{0.5\textwidth}
  \includegraphics{./figures/geneModes_TE.pdf}
  \caption{TE scores for regulatory modes of gene expression -  Schematic representation of regulatory modes of translation efficiency in a fold-change scatter plot. Indicated in red are changes in translation efficiency altering protein levels, in green changes in mRNA abundance and in blue changes in translation efficiency leading to translational buffering/offsetting. The shifts for the translation efficiency (TE) score are indicated. \label{fig:TE}}
\end{wrapfigure}

The TE- score approach has been shown to be prone to spurious
correlations (Larsson, Sonenberg, \& Nadon, 2010). Spurious correlations
arise due to that the ratio of polysome-associated mRNA and total mRNA
can systematically correlate with total mRNA levels which is not
corrected for in this equation and leads to an elevated type-1 error.

\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:TE}} gives an overview of the relationship
between a change in TE and each regulatory mode of gene expression
(\textbf{see also figure \ref{fig:modes}}). Changes in mRNA abundance
will lead to a \(\varDelta\)TE close to 0 in log space (i.e.~no change)
as total mRNA and translated mRNA change with a similar magnitude.
However, in the case of both translation and translational buffering,
terms in the TE-score equation change leading to a \(\varDelta\)TE (TE
\textless{} 0 or TE \textgreater{} 0) and thereby identification of both
changes in translation and translational buffering simultaneously.
Therefore, the TE-score method fails to differentiate between changes in
translation and translational buffering which can have drastic
consequences for the biological interpretation of the results (Oertlin
et al., 2019) (\textbf{see also section \ref{modes}}).

The TE-score approach was challenged by the Analysis of Translation
Activity (anota) algorithm which was developed for DNA-microarray data
(Larsson, Sonenberg, \& Nadon, 2011). anota combines analysis of partial
variance (APV)(Schleifer, Eckholdt, Cohen, \& Keller, 1993) with a
random variance model (RVM)(G. W. Wright \& Simon, 2003). RVM estimates
gene variance using shared information across all genes to increase
power for detection of differential expression(G. W. Wright \& Simon,
2003). anota uses a two-step process that firstly assesses the model
assumptions for (i) absence of highly influential data points, (ii)
common slopes of sample classes, (iii) homoscedasticity of residuals and
(iv) normal distribution of per gene residuals. In the second step then
performs analysis of changes in translational activity using the
following model:

\[log(y_{gi}) = \beta_g^{RNA}\ X_i^{RNA}+ \beta_g^{cond}\ X_i^{cond} + \varepsilon_{gi}\]

here \(\beta_g^{RNA}\) described the relationship to total RNA \(gth\)
gene \(ith\) sample of model matrix \(X\); \(\beta_g^{cond}\) represent
the log2 fold change for treatment classes and \(\varepsilon_{gi}\)
denotes the residual error.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{0.5\textwidth}
  \includegraphics{./figures/geneModes_anota_Larsson.pdf}
  \caption{anota gene models - Schematic representation of the anota analysis models. Translation mRNA expression is set out against total mRNA expression for each biological replicate and treatment condition. Top left shows the model of a gene that is deferentially translated (i.e. change in translated but not total mRNA). The difference in the slope intercepts are used to estimate changes in translation efficiencies between conditions i.e. dTE. Other gene models are shown; change in translation efficiency with varying total mRNA levels (top right); change in mRNA abundance (bottom left) and translational buffering (bottom right).
  \label{fig:anota}}
\end{wrapfigure}

Within anota a common slope for the treatment classes that describes the
translated mRNA to total mRNA relationship is calculated. The difference
between the slope intercepts is then interpreted as the \(\varDelta\)
TE. A simplified view of this model can be seen in (\textbf{Figure
\ref{fig:anota} top left}). Here expression for translated mRNA and
total mRNA are modeled over two sample classes with each 4 replicates.
Furthermore, changes in translation efficiencies can also be observed
when translated mRNAs shift to a larger extent than the total mRNA
levels (\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:anota} top right}). Identification of
genes in this category can be a challenge, especially in highyl variable
data set, as they resemble mRNA abundance genes (\textbf{Figure
\ref{fig:anota} bottom left}). Nevertheless, Using the linear regression
analysis anota accurately corrects changes in translated mRNA as can be
seen in (\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:anota} bottom right}) where a change in
total mRNA but not translated mRNA levels is observed. For this gene the
difference in slope intercepts is small and will not be identified as
difference in translation as would be the case in the TE-score approach.
anota was developed at a time where translational buffering was
uncommonly seen in data sets. Naturally, the methods lacks a setting to
analyse translational buffering. This was addressed in anota's
successor, anota2seq, and will be discussed in \textbf{Study 1}.

Advances in experimental methods warrant for appropriate statistical
methods to analyse data resulting from them. DNA- microarray was the
dominant platform to assess genome-wide changes before the advent of RNA
sequencing. In DNA- microarray RNA hybridizes probes on a chip and
generate a signal of which the measured intensity is an indicator of
expression, whereas in RNA sequencing reads from RNAs are counted.
Intensity data from DNA microarray can be normalised and transformed
(i.e.~log transformation) to fulfill the requirements for application of
linear models, whereas RNA sequencing harbours additional
characteristics that need to be accounted for. Therefore, algorithms
developed for analysis of DNA- microarray are not directly applicable to
RNA sequencing data as is the case for the anota algorithm.

RNA sequencing data shows variance that is greater than the mean which
is commonly referred to as overdispersion. Count data from RNA
sequencing have been initially approached using Poisson distributions
which assumes that the variance is equal to the mean(J. Lu et al.,
2005). Now established RNA sequencing analysis frameworks such as edgeR
and DESeq2 use negative binomial distributions in combination with
generalized linear models (GLMs) (Robinson, McCarthy, \& Smyth, 2010,
Love, Huber, \& Anders (2014)). The negative binomial distribution uses
a dispersion parameter to account for differences in the mean-variance
relationship across the expression range (McCarthy, Chen, \& Smyth,
2012). While analysis principles of DESeq2 and edgeR are similar they
differ in their normalisation method, dispersion estimation and
information sharing across genes. In a simple differential expression
analysis between two conditions with one RNA type the GLM model would be
as in the following equation:

\[log(y_{gi}) = \beta_g^{cond}\ X_i^{cond} + \varepsilon_{gi}\]

here \(\beta_g^{cond}\ X_i^{cond}\) represent the condition
(i.e.~control and treatment) log2 fold change for the \(gth\) gene
\(ith\) sample of the model matrix X and \(\varepsilon_{gi}\) denotes
the residual error. When analysing changes in translation effiencies
additional parameter for RNA type (i.e.~total mRNA or translated mRNA)
and the interaction between the RNA type and condition are added so
that:

\[log(y_{gi}) = \beta_g^{RNA}\ X_i^{RNA}+ \beta_g^{cond}\ X_i^{cond} + \beta_g^{RNA:cond}\ X_i^{interaction} + \varepsilon_gi\]

In this model the interaction term is interpreted as the change in
translation effiencies (Chothani et al., 2019). Other methods
(i.e.~Ribodiff(Zhong et al., 2017), Riborex(W. Li, Wang, Uren, Penalva,
\& Smith, 2017) and deltaTE (Chothani et al., 2019)) borrow this
analysis principle of an GLM with an interaction term by often applying
this exact model. A notable difference is that Ribodiff allows
dispersion estimation for translated mRNA and total mRNA separately as
variance differences between the RNA types can be expected due to
varying experimental protocols (Zhong et al., 2017, Liang et al.
(2018)). While the flexibility of GLMs allows for complex study designs
involving 2 or more treatment conditions, Riborex and Ribodiff limit the
study design to only two conditions. DeltaTE gives their users full
flexibility of the DESeq2 GLM model. Xtail is a method developed for
ribosome profiling that makes use of DESeq2 for RNAseq count
normalisation (Z. Xiao, Zou, Liu, \& Yang, 2016). Their assessment of
differences in translation efficiencies relies on probability matrices
for the ratio of translated mRNA over total mRNA within condition and a
between condition ratio of these ratios. Babel was the first algorithm
designed solely for analysis of differential translation and uses an
error-in-variables regression analysis (A. B. Olshen et al., 2013). The
error-in- variables regression allows accounting for variable total mRNA
levels when assessing changes in translation. Although these methods
have distinct approaches to identify changes in translation
efficiencies, their principle of analysis is similar to comparing a
ratio of ratios. Therefore these methods suffer from similar issues as
the TE-score which will be discussed in \textbf{Study 1}.

\chapter{Aims of this thesis}

The aims of this thesis are to expand current methodologies for analysis
of translation efficiency data and explore the regulation of gene
expression in cancer.

In \textbf{Study I} we adapted an algorithm for ANalysis Of Translation
Activity data (anota) so that it could be applied to next generation
sequencing data. Furthermore, we implemented the analysis of
translational buffering a recently described regulatory mode of gene
expression. The resulting algorithm was named anota2seq.

We then applied the anota2seq algorithm to investigate changes in
translation efficiencies in two cancer models:

In \textbf{Study II} we unraveled the effects of eIF4A, an RNA helicase,
inhibition using a synthetic rocaglate CR-1-31-B (CR-31) in pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma.

In \textbf{Study III} we explored the effects of insulin on gene
expression in multiple cell lines.

\chapter{Results and discussion}

\section{Study 1 - Generally applicable transcriptome-wide analysis of translation using anota2seq}

Initially changes in translation efficiencies were estimated using the
TE-score approach as outlined in section \ref{algorithm}. However, this
method was being shown to be prone to identification of spurious
correlations leading to elevated false positive identification that can
result in false biological conclusions (Larsson et al., 2010). The
identification of spurious correlations, when using the TE-score, can be
attributed the inadequate correction for changes in total mRNA levels
when estimating translation efficiencies (Larsson et al., 2010,Larsson
et al. (2011)). The Analysis of Translation Activity (anota) algorithm
facilitates analysis of translational efficiencies that are corrected
for changes in total mRNA levels and therefore is not prone to spurious
correlations(Larsson et al., 2011).

anota was developed for analysis of transcriptome-wide analysis for data
quantified by DNA- microarrays (Larsson et al., 2010). However, advances
in experimental methodologies lead to the development in RNA sequencing.
RNA sequencing and DNA microarray data have distinct characteristics
that need to be accounted for before analysis (\textbf{see section
\ref{algorithm}}). Therefore, while the statistical framework of anota
had been shown as an adequate approach for analysis of translational
efficiencies for data from DNA microarrays it was not directly
applicable to RNA sequencing data. The characteristic of RNA sequencing
data, that makes applying anota directly not possible, is the mean
variance relationship. This encompasses that the counts for lower
expressed genes show higher variability than counts for higher expressed
genes even after log transformation. Efforts have been made to make RNA
sequencing data more DNA- microarray like so that algorithms developed
for intensity based microarray data can be applied to count based RNA
sequencing data (Law, Chen, Shi, \& Smyth, 2014,Love et al. (2014)).
Anota2seq, the algorithm developed in this study, allows for
transformation and normalisation of RNA sequencing data so that the
anota statistical frame work can be applied for analysis of count data.

Another feature of anota2seq is that it allows for statistical analysis
of translational buffering. The need for the analysis of translational
buffering, or the uncoupling of transcription from translation, has been
noted before anota2seq's development by comparing 20 translatomes and
transcriptomes with different underlying stimuli in mammalian cells
(Tebaldi et al., 2012). The same authors proposed a framework, called
tRanslatome, that combines several methodologies for analysis of
differential transcription and translation efficiencies, including
anota, for a comprehensive analysis of transcription and translation as
well as their underlying mechanisms (Tebaldi, Dassi, Kostoska, Viero, \&
Quattrone, 2014).

  \caption{anota2seq gene model for analysis of translational buffering /offsetting - Total mRNA expression is set out against translated mRNA expression for each biological replicate and treatment condition. The model shows total mRNA changes that are independent of translated mRNA changes which is classified as translational buffering. It is important to distinguish between the gene modes as their regulation could be due to different underlying biological mechanisms (see section \ref{modes}).
  \label{fig:anota2seq}}
\end{wrapfigure}

Nevertheless, commonly observed in polysome and ribosome profiling data
sets are three gene expression modes, translation, translational
buffering and mRNA abundance. While anota can be used to identify genes
among the translation and mRNA abundance mode, analysis for
translational buffering was not implemented therein (\emph{See Figure
\ref{fig:anota}}). Therefore, one would need to rely on the integration
of several methods to efficiently analyse transcriptome-wide studies of
translation efficiences. Anota2seq addresses this issue by changing the
analysis model as described in section \ref{algorithm} to analyse
changes in total mRNA levels corrected for changes in translated mRNA
levels (i.e.~translational buffering, \textbf{see figure
\ref{fig:anota2seq}}).

Appliance of anota2seq has successfully identified translational
buffering to which biological mechanisms could be linked, e.g.~as
mentioned earlier translationally bufferring under ER\(\alpha\)
depletion in prostate cancer (\textbf{see section \ref{modeBuffering}})
(Lorent et al., 2019). Furthermore, in \textbf{study 2} translational
buffering can be observed as a compensating mechanisms in ``healthy''
cells upon treatment with an eIF4A inhibitor and in \textbf{study 3} we
identify mTOR dependent translational buffering for mRNAs with certain
3' UTR characteristics.

The aim of this study is to compare anota2seq's performance to other
established algorithms (i.e.~DESeq2, RiboDiff, babel, TE-score and
Xtail) for analysis of translation efficiencies, specifically their
ability to distinguish the three prominent modes of gene expression. To
achieve we used a simulated data based approach. While it is arguable to
what extent conclusion drawn from simulated data can be extended towards
empirical data it allows for a controlled environment where true
positive changes are known in advance. Furthermore, the mean-variance
relationship in the simulated data is based on a real polysome profiling
data set to increase confidence that drawn conclusions are also
applicable to empirical data (Guan et al., 2017).

The simulated data consisted of four replicates for translated mRNA and
total mRNA with a ``control'' and a ``treatment'' condition.
Furthermore, the data sets contained a combination of the following gene
sets:

``Unchanged'': For this simulation category we drew reads from the same
NB distribution for both the control and treatment conditions in both
the translated and total mRNA. This category represents genes that would
be unaffected by e.g.~a stimulus of between cellular states.

``mRNA abundance'': For this category the control condition for both the
translated mRNA and total mRNA were drawn from the same NB distribution.
The NB distribution for \emph{both translated mRNA and total mRNA} of
the treatment condition was altered so that values would be drawn
corresponding to a fold change (negative or positive) ranging between
1.5 to 3.0. The directionality of the fold changes (i.e.~up or down
regulation) was the same for translated mRNA and total mRNA.

``translation'': For this category the control condition for both the
translated mRNA and total mRNA were drawn from the same NB distribution.
The NB distribution for \emph{translated mRNA only} of the treatment
condition was altered so that values would be drawn corresponding to a
fold change (negative or positive) ranging between 1.5 to 3.0.

``buffering'': For this category the control condition for both the
translated mRNA and total mRNA were drawn from the same NB distribution.
The NB distribution for \emph{total mRNA only} of the treatment
condition was altered so that values would be drawn corresponding to a
fold change (negative or positive) ranging between 1.5 to 3.0.

As a first step we tested whether the methods could properly control for
type-1 errors (i.e.~false positive identification). For this we
simulated a data set with genes belonging only to the ``unchanged''
category. This revealed that babel, but to an even greater extent Xtail,
were unable to control their type-1 error as these methods assigned low
p-values and FDRs when no real changes were present. This indicated a
limited applicability of Xtail and babel for statistical analysis of
translatomes.

From the comparative analysis of the analysis for changes in translation
efficiencies affecting protein levels we concluded that anota2seq
outperforms all other methods. This was assessed by comparing the area
under the curve from Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and
precision recall curves. The ROC curves showed a, albeit slightly,
better performance for detecting changes in translation. However, the
precision recall was much higher for anota2seq which can be accredited
to that the analysis principle of the other methods is based on
identifying changes regardless of whether the change is in the
translated mRNA or total mRNA (\emph{as explained in section
\ref{algorithm}}). Nevertheless, when comparing the performance using
simulated data in the absence of genes belonging to the ``buffering''
category anota2seq still showed superior performance.

Next to the a prior knowledge of the introduced changes in the
simulation data, it also allowed us to modify parameters to investigate
the robustness of the methods to increased variance, overall sequencing
depth and differing sequencing depth between samples. Here, all methods
showed robustness against variance and sequencing depth differences
between samples as long as a minimum of 5 million counts per sample was
reached.

A short coming in the simulation study is that we did not assess the
effects of systematic batch effects. Batch effects can be introduced
e.g.~during experimental design and there are many methods that try to
correct for these(W. E. Johnson, Li, \& Rabinovic, 2007,Leek (2014),Y.
Zhang, Parmigiani, \& Johnson (2020)). Other ways to correct for batch
effects is their inclusion in the analysis model, which can be supplied
to the analysis model in DESeq2, edgeR as well as anota2seq. Indeed
analysis of a dataset with prominent batch effects showed that batch
effects can dampen the efficiency of the anota2seq algorithm to identify
changes but can be effectively corrected for in the algorithm.

In this study we developed an analysis algorithm for efficient
transcriptome-wide analysis of translation efficiencies applicable to
DNA-microarrays and RNA seq. Furthermore, anota2seq has been
successfully applied to broaden the knowledge around mRNA translation in
various different contexts (Lorent et al., 2019,Chan et al.
(2019),Hipolito et al. (2019),Chaparro et al. (2020)).

\section{Study 2 - eIF4A supports an oncogenic translation program in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma}

Pancreatic cancer is considered a lethal malignancy and has limited
treatment options. A study on predictions for european cancer mortality
rates for 2021 concluded that health efforts should focus on pancreatic
cancer. While other cancers (e.g.~ovary, breast and stomach) showed a
decline in mortality rates, no major overall decline was observed for
pancreatic cancer in the period of 1970-2021 (Carioli et al., 2021).

Pancreatic ductal adeno carcinoma (PDAC) accounts for over 90\% of
exocrine pancreatic cancer, whereas non ductal pancreatic cancers
e.g.~acinar cell carcinomas are uncommon (Feldmann, Beaty, Hruban, \&
Maitra, 2007,Jun \& Hong (2016)). It is estimated the 60-70\% of the
PDACs arise in the head (Luchini, Capelli, \& Scarpa, 2016). So far
treatment options are mostly limited to surgical removal, which can be
complicated due to the anatomical location of the pancreas head.

With the increasing understanding of tumor heterogeneity, i.e.~tumors
with similar tissue origin are not necessarily identical at a molecular
level, anti cancer therapy improved (Biankin \& Hudson, 2011). In breast
cancer stratification by histological,molecular and gene expression
features lead to identification of several breast cancer subtypes for
which different treatment options exist, e.g. \(ER^+\) breast cancer
subtypes respond to endocrine therapy whereas \(ER^-\) do not(Andre \&
Pusztai, 2006,Parker et al. (2009)). While breast cancer treatment
strategies benefit from a rather well established understanding of the
molecular subtypes, in pancreatic cancer transcriptomic based subtyping
is still ongoing (P. Bailey et al., 2016,Puleo et al. (2018),Collisson
et al. (2011),Moffitt et al. (2015),Collisson, Bailey, Chang, \& Biankin
(2019)). Therefore, it is warranted to extend current knowledge around
pancreatic cancer to advance therapeutic strategies in this lethal
disease.

While intricacies of molecular subtypes are still being investigated,
research has shown that oncogenic mutations in KRAS as well as
inactivation of tumor supressors e.g.~TP53 are commonly shared among
PDAs (S. Jones et al., 2008). Furthermore, PDAs have been shown to be
dependent on increased protein synthesis mediated by Kras (Chio et al.,
2016). This indicates an important role of mRNA translation in PDA.

The aim of \emph{study 2} was to investigate the therapeutic effects of
targeting eIF4A in a three dimensional PDA organoid cell culture with
mutations in the \(Kras^{LSL-G12D}\), \(Trp53^{LSL-R172H}\) and Pdx1-cre
alleles that has been shown to recapitulate PDA tumor progression (Boj
et al., 2015). The inhibition of eIF4A was done using a synthetic
rocaglate, CR-1-31B (CR-31). Rocaglates have been shown to inhibit eIF4A
helicase activity and displayed anti tumor activity (Cencic et al.,
2009).

We first wanted to establish the therapeutic validity of targeting eIF4A
in PDA. In vitro experiments comparing treated PDA organoids (KP) to
their normal (N) counter parts revealed heightened sensitivity of KP to
CR-31 treatment. OP-puromycin incorporation showed reduced protein
synthesis in KP, whereas N were affected to a lesser extent.
Furthermore, similar effects were found in vivo for PDA tumours. Here
CR-31 reduced protein synthesis (assessed by SUnSET assay), tumor growth
(assessed by ultra sound imaging) and increased survival. The effect on
protein synthesis was not due to inhibition of oncogenic signalling
pathways which was evaluated western blot assessing the phosphorylation
of e.g.~AKT, mTOR and 4E-BP1. From these findings we concluded that
there is therapeutic validity in targeting eIF4A in PDA that acts
downstream of oncogenic signalling pathways.

Using polysome profiling we then sought to decipher the mechanisms
explaining the increased sensitivity to CR-31 in KP organoids. First we
investigated the differences in gene expression between untreated KP and
N organoids. Analysis of changes in translation efficiencies using
anota2seq revealed massive modulation at both transcription and
translation indicative of underlying differences in e.g.~genomic
stability and enhanced oncogenic signalling impinging on protein
synthesis reported in PDA (Boj et al., 2015). Consistent with the in
vitro OP-puromycin incorporation and in vivo SUNsET experiments, CR-31
had only little effect on translation in N organoids, whereas in KP
organoids exclusively changes in translation were detected.

We then compared the mRNAs affected by CR-31 in KP to the acquired
translational profile of untreated KP and N organoids. In order to
achieve this we visualised the mRNAs affected by CR-31 in KP onto the
data of the untreated KP vs N organoids comparison. This revealed that
the acquired translational program of KP organoids is reversed when
treated with CR-31.

Performing a similar analysis, we visualised mRNAs sensitive to CR-31 in
KP onto the data of the CR-31 treated N organoids. mRNAs affected by
CR-31 in KP were translationally buffered in CR-31 treated N organoids.
Translational buffering, as an adaptive response to treatment, has been
shown to maintain protein homeostasis by inducing a transcriptional
response increasing the pool of mRNAs that can be translated (Lorent et
al., 2019). The ability for N organoids in increase transcription for
mRNAs affected by CR-31, whereas KP cannot, could partially explain as
to why protein synthesis is not reduced to a similar extent in N as in
KP.

We then assessed 5' UTR characteristics of the translationally regulated
mRNAs upon CR-31 treatment in KP organoids. It was reported that
eIF4A-senstive mRNAs showed overall and more structured 5' UTRs
(e.g.~containing G-quadruplexes) (Rubio et al., 2014,Wolfe et al.
(2014),Gandin et al. (2016b)). Furthermore, a mechanisms by which
rocaglates would clamp eIF4A to mRNAs with {[}A,G{]} repeats in their 5
UTR was described (Iwasaki, Floor, \& Ingolia, 2016). However, mRNAs
sensitive to CR-31 treatment herein showed overall shorter 5' UTRs that
were more structured when corrected for their length without enrichment
for 4G-quadruplexes or {[}A,G{]} repeats. From the polysome profiling
and UTR analysis we concluded that eIF4A supports an oncogenic
translation program in PDA cells for mRNAs with shorter but structured
5' UTRs.

Shorter 5' UTRs have been shown to be sensitive to eIF4E expression and
encode for metabolic functions (see section \ref{regmRNA}). When we
compared an eIF4E overexpression signature in the KP vs N and CR-31
treated KP we observed that in KP organoids translationally regulated
mRNAs under eIF4E overexpression were also translationally activated.
This observation is consistent with reports of 4E-BP1 loss in pancreatic
cancer (Y. Martineau et al., 2014). eIF4A inhibition in tumors resistant
to mTOR inhibiton by loss of 4E-BP1 has been shown to circumvent this
resistance (D. M√ºller et al., 2019). Indeed, CR-31 treatment in KP
reversed the translational profile for eIF4E sensitive mRNAs. Therefore,
while rocaglates have been shown to directly target eIF4A (Cencic et
al., 2009), eIF4F complex formation could be disrupted by reduced eIF4A
availability to an extent that also cap dependent translation is
affected in PDA organoids herein.

When further inspecting the regulated gene sets in treated and untreated
KP compared to their normal counterparts we could see an enrichment in
metabolic pathways, e.g.~Oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway was
upregulated in untreated KP compared to N, whereas in KP CR-31 treatment
reversed the translational profile of this pathway. Indeed, when we
measured mitochondrial respiration (by oxygen consumption rates) we
found that CR-31 treatment in KP disrupted this process, whereas N
organoids where affected to a lesser extent.

A way to counter loss of energy production through oxidative
phosphorylation is to increase activity of other anaerobic metabolic
pathways, i.e.~glycolysis. However, in CR-31 treated KP we could not
detect a upregulation of glycolysis measured by \(U-C^{13}\) glucose
labeling and extra cellular acidification rates nor did CR-31 treatment
affect expression of glycolytic enzymes (e.g.~HK1,HK2, LDHA, SLCA1,
SLCA3). Furthermore, glucose deprivation did not further sensitise to
CR-31 treatment. This was rather unexpected, given that increased
glycolysis is characteristic for cancers as described by Otto walburg
(Warburg, Wind, \& Negelein, 1927). However, the polysome prolfing data
revealed translational downregulation and subsequent reduction of
protein expression for the glucose transporter Slc2a6. Indeed,
perturbation of Slc2a6 using \(sgRNA^{Slc2a6}\) in N and KP organoids
revealed a decrease in glucose uptake. From this we concluded that
glycolytic compensation of KP is diminished by translational regulation
of the glucose transporter Slc2a6 upon CR-31 treatment.

Among the translationally activated genes in the CR-31 treated KP
organoids where mRNAs involved in the glutamine metabolism (i.e.~Slc1a5
and Gls1). Furthermore, glutamine levels were elevated in patient
derived PDA cell lines treated with CR-31. Glutamine can be converted
into \(\alpha\)-ketoglutarate and funneled into the krebs cycle and
therefore can serve to increase energy production (D. Xiao et al.,
2016). Indeed, using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to
quantify metabolites after culturing PDA cells in \(C_5^{13}\)-
glutamine, we identified a shift towards reductive carboxylation of
\(\alpha\)-ketoglutarate obtained from \(C_5^{13}\)- glutamine to
produce acetyl-CoA. Notably, the glutamine metabolism was not elevated
in N organoids.

A combined treatment of CR-31 with glutaminase inhibitors (BPTES or
CB839) could sensitise to CR-31 treatment patient-derived PDA cells to
CR-31 treatment. Therefore, our study suggests an eIF4A dependent
translational program in PDA that can act as a theurapeutic target in
PDA. Furthermore, a recently published ribosome profiling study of a
CR-31 treated human pancreatic cancer cell line (PANC1) observed the
same therapeutic effect of CR-31 treatment in vivo on survival and tumor
volume (Singh et al., 2021). This underlines the significance of our
study in identifying eIF4A as therapeutic target in PDA.

Nevertheless, the same study indicated differences on the underlying
regulated mRNA subsets. They report, in line with the literature, that
eIF4A depdent mRNAs show long and structured 5' UTRs containing
G-quadruplexes (Singh et al., 2021,Wolfe et al. (2014)). While the 5'
UTRs of the mRNAs identified herein where overall shorter, they were
overall more structured. Furthermore, the mRNAs identifed in Singh et.
al. were involved in KRAS signalling, which was unaltered in our study.
Nevertheless, whether G-quadruplexes can actually form stably in cells
is still iverstigated. Furthermore, the authors chose to use ribosome
profiling in their study that provides nucleotide resolution of ribosome
occupancy which could give insights whether ribosomes would stall at
such g-quadruplex sites and therefore their possibly their formation.
Yet, the authors did not exploit this feature of their applied
experimental methodology.

This raises some questions about the differences between experimental
setups and their potential influence on biological outcomes and
interpretation thereof. For instance, Singh et. al. performed ribosome
profiling on a PANC1 cell line culture treated with 25nM CR-31, wheres
herein we performed polysome profiling on a 3D-organoid culture treated
with 10nM CR-31. The differences between ribosome and polysome profiling
have been discussed extensively (see section \ref{exptMethod}).
Furthermore, by measuring IC50 concentrations for CR-31 in a panel of
pancreatic cancer cell lines, Singh et. al. show a
\textasciitilde{}6-fold difference in susceptability to CR-31 between
the cell lines of which PANC1 cells were most sensitive to CR-31. Dosage
dependent viability experiments of patient derived PDA cells in our
study revealed that at 10nM CR-31 treatment cell viability was reduced
by \textasciitilde{}30\%, whereas treatment with 25nM reduced viability
by \textgreater{} 50\%. Furthermore, in patient derived PDA a
combination treatment of CR-31 and CB839 showed no synergistic effects
at 25nM CR-31, whereas at 12.50nM synergy was observed. Therefore,
combining the findings of these two studies indicate that CR-31
treatment in PDA indeed has a therapeutic effect, however the underlying
mechanisms that are observed in the transcriptome wide analysis of
translation efficiencies could be dependent on the experimental method
to assess mRNA translation, the model system and treatment dosages.

\section{Study 3 - mTOR-dependent translational buffering overrides transcriptome alterations leading to
maintained proteome composition}

Breast cancer is an umbrella term for a heterogeneous disease with
numerous molecular subtypes with different clinical behaviour.
Currently, breast cancer is classified into five major groups; luminal
A, luminal B, HER-2, basal and normal like. The classification is based
on histopatholgy and receptor status. Histopathological are determined
by the degree of tumor differentiation (tubule formation), nuclear
pleomorphism and proliferation (mitotic count). These features are then
scored into a histological grade (I-III) (Eliyatkin, Yal√ßin, Zengel,
Akta≈ü, \& Vardar, 2015). As mentioned earlier, receptor status of the
progesterone (PR), estrogen (ER) and HER-2 are evaluated and have
implications for neo adjuvant and adjuvant treatment strategies.
Advances in technologies lead to classification of breast cancer
subtypes using gene expression profiles,e.g.~the PAM50 classification,
that allow for unbiased classification of breast cancer (Parker et al.,
2009). A study that correlated the gene expression profiles of the PAM50
classification found a significanlty higher mRNA:protein correlation for
PAm50 genes, indicating their prognostic value (Johansson et al., 2019).
Nevertheless, the authors observed intermixed luminal B and HER2
clustering based on protein expression in line with the literature that
HER2 subtypes receive conflicting mRNA based classifications (Johansson
et al., 2019,Prat et al. (2014)). Thus, the understanding of breast
cancer subtypes has increased tremendously leading to improved and
targeted treatment options, however there is need for further research
to understand the full breast cancer spectrum on a molecular level.

Another important factor to consider in breast cancer treatment are life
style and other health related issues that could impact cancer
progression or response to treatment, e.g.~obesity. Studies in the 1970
observed unfavorable prognosis for breast cancer in obese women (Abe,
Kumagai, Kimura, Hirosaki, \& Nakamura, 1976). More recent studies
observed endocrine therapy to be less effective in obese patients and
increased cancer incidence in individuals with higher weight or lack of
physical activity (K. Lee, Kruper, Dieli-Conwright, \& Mortimer,
2019,Eheman et al. (2012)). Obesity can pose an increased risk to
develop metabolic disorders such as metabolic syndrome or type 2
diabetes that can lead to hyperinsulinemia, i.e.~elevated physiological
insulin levels (Saltiel, 2001).

The role of insulin in the body is to regulate glucose and lipid
metabolism as well as protein synthesis. Protein synthesis and
metaboloism are often dysregulated in cancer (Saltiel, 2001,Hanahan \&
Weinberg (2011)). Insulin can bind to both IGF1R and INSR that activate
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/ERK signalling pathways. A role of insulin in
cancer progression has initially been observed in long term tissues
cultures where it increased metabolism as well as growth (Osborne,
Bolan, Monaco, \& Lippman, 1976). Another growth factor that is similar
to insulin is IGF1 which acts to the same receptors as insulin. IGF1
plays a role in cancer progression and its levels are elevated upon
hyperinsulinemia (Christopoulos, Msaouel, \& Koutsilieris, 2015,Bailyes
et al. (1997),A. Molinaro et al. (2019),Gallagher \& LeRoith (2010)).

The importance of both IGF1 and insulin signalling in cancer has been
well established now and led to development of therapeutic strategies by
e.g.~targeting both IGF1R and INSR or the PI3K signalling pathway
(Kuijjer et al., 2013,Mayer et al. (2017)). Yet, to this day the full
extent of insulin signalling on gene expression in cancer has not been
established. This study aims to bridge this gap in knowledge by
elucidating the effects of insulin signalling on gene expression using a
multi-omics (including transcriptomics, translatomics and proteomics)
approach to capture multiple steps of the gene expression pathway
simultaneously. Furthermore, we asses insulin signalling in cancer cells
as well as non-transformed epithelial cells.

We first investigated the effects of insulin on gene expression in a
luminal A breast cancer cell line, i.e.~MCF7 cells. Polysome-profiling
revealed a strong transcripional and translational response upon insulin
stimulation. Among the translationally activated mRNAs were mRNAs with
short 5' UTRs that harboured TOP motifs which is n accordance that
insulin signalling leads to activation of mTORC1 and phosphorylation of
its downstream targets. When visualising the mRNAs in the data where
MCF7 cells were stimulated with insulin in the presence of torin1, an
mTOR active site inhibitor, we observed that the changes in mRNA
translation were almost fully reversed. This led to the conclusion that
the effects of insulin on gene expression are to a great extent
dependent on mTOR activity.

What was surprising to us was the observation that a subset of mRNAs
exhibited translational buffering upon insulin stimulation while mTOR is
inhibited. For these mRNAs, the total mRNA levels were increased,
whereas the polysome-association was unaltered between conditions
effectively uncoupling transcription from translation. As has been seen
by others, we confirm that translationally buffered mRNAs maintain
constant protein expression across conditions using HiRIEF LC/MS (Lorent
et al., 2019, R. M. M. Branca et al. (2014)). These findings indicate
that mTOR can act as a gatekeeper for transcriptional programs to fine
tune translation in response to extra cellular or intra cellular
signals.

MCF7 cells are of epithelial origin and therefore not ``classical''
insulin sensitive such as adipose tissue or muscle cells. Their strong
response to insulin prompted us to investigate whether this could be due
to cellular plasticity in cancer. To assess this we chose to compare the
effects found in MCF7 to a non-malignant epithelial cell type, i.e.~HMEC
cells. We found that insulin alone was not sufficient to stimulate the
PI3k/AKT/mTOR pathway in HMEC to a similar extent as in MCF7. However, a
combination treatment of insulin and IGF1 in HMEC cells elicited a
similar reponse as insulin treatment in MCF7 alone. Furthermore, it is
known that during hyperinsulinemia IGF1 levels are increased and both
IGF1 and insulin signalling has been associated with cancer (Gallagher
\& LeRoith, 2010). We therefore opted to compare the combined insulin +
IGF1 treatment in HMEC to that of MCF7 assuming their signalling
cascades are nearly identical as proposed in the literature (Pollak,
2008,Boucher, Tseng, \& Kahn (2010)).

Polysome profiling of the insulin + IGF1 stimulated HMEC cells revealed
a strong translational response, but was lacking the transcriptional
activation found in MCF7 cells. Translationally activated mRNAs in HMEC
showed 5' UTR features similar to those in MCF7 cells. Consequently,
their translational activation was dependent on mTOR signalling evident
from their translational suppression under conditions when mTOR was
inhibited during insulin + IGF stimulation. Furthermore, comparing the
mRNA signatures of HMEC and MCF7 in the opposite cell line we could
observe that changes at the level of translation were almost fully in
accord across cell types.

In contrast to MCF7 cells, HMEC did not elicit a strong transcriptional
response as shown by the small number of changes in mRNA abundance.
However, when comparing a recently described transcription signature
induced after INSR translocation to the nucleus, we could see that in
both HMEC and MCF7 these mRNA show changes in total mRNA levels but of
differing magnitude (Hancock et al., 2019). A possible explanation for
the different response in transcription could be due to differences in
chromosome instability between the cell lines that expose different
parts of the DNA to trans acting factors. While not assessed herein, a
transcription factor analysis paired with chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) sequencing could provide insight into this (Solomon, Larsen, \&
Varshavsky, 1988,P. J. Park (2009)). Assuming a consequence of having a
weaker transcriptional response, HMEC cells did not elicit translational
buffering upon insulin + IGF1 stimulation when mTOR was inhibited. Thus
the effects of insulin and IGF1 signalling on mRNA translation are
foremost mTOR dependent, however total mRNA responses differ between
malignant and non-malignant epithelial cells.

The translational buffering in MCF7 prompted us to investigate this
phenomenon more. To assess differences dependent on mRNA characteristics
we defined two subsets. The ``reversed'' and the ``uncoupled'' (that is
translationally buffered when mTOR is inhibited) subsets that only
differed in their total mRNA response when mTOR was inhibited during
insulin stimulation. To rule out that the observed effects on total mRNA
are technical artifacts we validated total mRNA levels for two genes
from each subset. The differences in regulation of gene expression were
not dependent on codon usage which has been described before in a
different context(Lorent et al., 2019). However, overall uncoupled mRNAs
had shorter 3' UTRs with a higher GC content and were depleted for HuR
binding sites.

The depletion of HuR binding sites in the 3' UTRs of the uncoupled
subset prompted us to investigate mRNA stability differences. Using a
time series experiment under actinomycin D treatment to block
transcription quantified using nanoString, we found significant longer
mRNA half lifes for the uncoupled subset as compared to the reversed
subset. From these data we hypothesised that there are different
underlying mechanisms that regulate gene expression under conditions
where mRNA translation is dampened between these subsets. Under this
hypothesis the reversed subset is likely regulated through mRNA
stability, whereas the more stable uncoupled subset requires to be
regulated by translation as their total mRNA level remains high for
longer periods of time.

The involvement of HuR in this cannot be fully supported with our
current data as the analysis only supports a correlation between the
occurrence of HuR binding sites and the 3' UTRs of the reversed subset.
The effect on stability could be due to other trans acting factors such
as miRNAs (Valinezhad Orang, Safaralizadeh, \& Kazemzadeh-Bavili, 2014).
A way to increase confidence is to investigate HuRs involvement
experimentally, e.g.~we could use a sgRNA to silence HuR and measure
total mRNA levels of the reversed and uncoupled mRNAs previously
validated by qPCR. If HuR is involved, we would expect that the reversed
mRNAs retain higher total mRNA levels under the condition where mTOR is
inhibited during insulin stimulation in MCF7 cells as compared to
control. Furthermore, while the differences in total mRNA levels between
the insulin and the insulin and torin1 treated conditions in the RNAseq
data imply a treatment effect on the mRNA stability we did not observe
this in the time chase experiment quantified by nanoString. This raises
the question whether the transcription block induced by actinomycin D
could influence the regulation of mRNA stability between treatments. We
could address this by including actinomycin D in the sgHuR experiment
and see if effects thereof differ or an experiment independent of sgHuR.
Presence of such an effect could indicate a cross talk between
transcription and regulation of mRNA stability.

Since the translational buffering identified herein was only observed in
insulin treated cancer cells, we wondered whether this is only specific
to this system. Cellular plasticity in cancer allows cancer cells to
obtain stem cell like features (Jewer et al., 2020,Wahl \& Spike
(2017),Quail, Taylor, \& Postovit (2012)). Therefore, we reasoned that a
system were we study gene expression of stem cells could give some
insight whether cancer cells obtained stem cell features that normal
epithelial cells do not have. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate
whether other means of mTOR inactivation, e.g.~hypoxia, would lead to
similar effects on gene expression. To assess these aspects we cultured
H9 stem cells in medium with insulin present in normoxia and hypoxia.
This experimental setup differs to that of MCF7 and HMEC cells as these
were serum starved (i.e.~no insulin in medium) prior to induction with
insulin.

Studying this system in H9 we could observe changes for all three modes
for regulation of gene expression. Most notably, we observed a large
fraction of translationally buffered mRNAs with similar 3' UTR
characteristics to that of the uncoupled subset in MCF7 cells. Using
publicly available data on mRNA stability we saw that the
translationally buffered mRNA were overall more stable as compared to
their background. Furthermore, visualising the reversed and uncoupled
subset identified in MCF7 in the H9 data we observe differences in their
regulation of total mRNA levels, indicating that these subset underlie
different regulations even across these two models. Furthermore, these
data argue for that translational buffering observed in insulin treated
MCF7 cells during mTOR inhibition is not limited to that system but can
also occur under more physiological conditions.

Here we present an unprecedented and comprehensive investigation of the
effects on insulin on gene expression in cancer cells and non-
transformed epithelial cells across multiple steps of the gene
expression pathway. Our results indicate that cancer cells have acquired
an increased sensitivity to insulin signalling as compared to
non-transformed epithelial cells that is largely dependent on mTOR in
both cell types. Furthermore, we observed that cancer cells have the
ability to translationally buffer mRNAs which is a feature they share
with stem cells.

\chapter{Conclusions}

Cancer is a vastly heterogeneous disease that is characterised by
uncontrollable growth and proliferation as well as dysregulated
metabolism that can evade therapy through acquiring resistance. mRNA
translation is a common denominator of these processes and it is
therefore paramount to understand the precise mechanisms by which mRNA
translation is regulated to better formulate therapeutic strategies
against cancer.

This thesis provides an advance in methodology to analyse
transcriptome-wide changes translation efficiencies that can be applied
to study cancer models. Using this methodology in the context of
pancreatic cancer we could propose a possible new therapeutic strategy
for this lethal disease where treatment options are limited. Lastly, we
explore the effects of insulin on gene expression in an unprecedented
study that highlighted an adapted insulin responsiveness of cancer
cells. Furthermore, we illuminate the ability of cancer cells to
translationally buffer genes which is a feature they share with stem
cells and could therefore be an acquired mechanism.

Taken together this thesis provides insight on gene expression in two
different cancer models that could potentially lead to clinical
applications. While these works are a step forward more research is
needed to grasp the full extent of the mechanisms involved in cancer.
