\chapter{Introduction}\section{Gene expression}\subsection{The central dogma of gene expression}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{.6\textwidth}
  \includegraphics{./figures/geneExprPath_2.pdf}
  \caption{The gene expression pathway - DNA is transcribed into RNA. RNAs are processed into mRNAs that consist of a 5' cap, exons and a poly(A) tail. mRNAs can be transported out of the cellular nucleus into the cytoplasm where they can be degraded, stored or translated into proteins depending on cellular demands. Synthesised proteins can be degraded by proteosomes. Coloured boxes in the DNA refer to introns (teal) and exons (purple). Introns are non-protein-encoding parts of the genome, whereas exons encode for proteins. mRNAs are depicted as purple lines, i.e. a series of exons, with an AAAAA extension and an oval shape at its start. Proteins are depicted as a series of pink balls.  \label{fig:geneExprPath}}
\end{wrapfigure}

In eukaryotic cells, genetic code is stored as deoxyribonucleic acid
(DNA) molecules in the nucleus. Transcription is the process whereby
temporary copies of the DNA are generated and occurs in the nucleus.
These copies are called ribonucleic acid (RNA). RNAs undergo processing
by which multiple different variants coming from the same gene are
produced. A subset of protein-encoding processed RNAs is the so called
messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNAs are transported from the nucleus into the
cytoplasm where they can be stored, degraded or translated into
proteins. Proteins themselves can also be degraded (\emph{see figure
\ref{fig:geneExprPath}}). This flow of genetic information into
expressed proteins is commonly referred to as the central dogma in
molecular biology (F. Crick, 1970). \clearpage
\subsection{Contribution to gene expression} Proteins are the last
product of the gene expression pathway and carry out the vast majority
of all cellular functions. While it is apparent that modulation of
protein levels will offer information on the changes in gene expression,
it cannot completely answer the question as to why the protein levels
change. In a disease context, protein levels alone might only offer
sufficient insight to explain phenotypic differences. Studying the
mechanisms that drive differences in protein levels is thus required to
improve understanding of biological processes and their dysregylation in
disease.

Recently developed system biology methods allow investigation of gene
expression at multiple levels on a genome-wide scale. Initially,
transcriptomics studies were applied to study gene expression with the
assumption that mRNA expression is the main determinant for protein
levels and therefore changes in transcipt abundance may be used as a
proxy for alterations in the proteome. However, this view was challenged
by several landmark studies that observed a poor mRNA to protein
correlation and indicated a larger role of post-transcriptional
regulation in gene expression than previously assumed (J. Lu et al.,
2005; Schwanh√§usser et al., 2011; G. M. Silva et al., 2016; Sousa Abreu
et al., 2009; Vogel et al., 2012).

The debate regarding which step of the gene expression pathway
contributes most to the composition of the proteome is ongoing,
nevertheless an understanding has been reached that the context under
which studies are carried out is a major determinant. At steady state,
mRNA levels seem to explain protein abundance best, however in perturbed
systems (e.g.~under stress or growth factor signalling) the contribution
of transcript abundance appears to have less impact relative to
post-transcriptional steps in regulation of gene expression (Y. Liu et
al., 2016). Moreover, it appears that correlation between mRNA and
protein levels also depends on the type of the stimulus. For example, in
a study that stimulated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells with LPS,
protein levels were dependent on cellular transcript levels (Jovanovic
et al., 2015). In contrast, a study investigating cells under
endoplasmatic reticulum stress observed extensive modulation of protein
levels, whereas mRNA abundance was only mildly affected (Cheng et al.,
2016).

Thus, the contribution of different steps of the gene expression is
dependent on many different factors, e.g.~cellular state or treatments.
mRNA translation is an essential process in determining composition of
the proteome. Furthermore, dysregulation of mRNA translation has been
observed in multiple diseases, ranging from neurological disorders to
cancer which warrants for a comprehensive understanding of this process
(Graff et al., 2009; Kapur et al., 2018; L. J. Lee et al., 2021;
Ruggero, 2013; Tahmasebi et al., 2018). This thesis focusses on
increasing understanding of the role of mRNA translation in cancer.
\newline
\section{mRNA translation} \subsection{Schematic representation of mRNA}
mRNAs contain a protein coding region which is flanked by untranslated
regions (5' and 3' UTRs). UTRs contain post-transcriptional regulatory
elements that may affect localisation, stability and translation of the
mRNA (Leppek et al., 2018; Loya et al., 2008; Mignone et al., 2002)
(\emph{see figure \ref{fig:UTRFeat}, see also section \ref{regmRNA} for
details}).

\begin{figure}[H]
  \includegraphics{./figures/UTRFeatures_2.pdf}
  \caption{ Schematic overview of mRNA - mRNA consists of a coding sequence, 5' and 3' untranslated regions flanking the coding sequence, a 5' cap and a poly-(A)-tail. Located within the 5' and 3' untranslated region are post-transcriptional regulatory elements that can influence gene expression. uORF; upstream open reading frame; IRES, internal ribosome entry site; CPE, cytoplasmic polyadenylation site; AAUAAA, polyadenylation signal. See section \ref{regmRNA} for details on these elements.
 \label{fig:UTRFeat}}
\end{figure}

The 5' end of mRNAs contain a 7-methyl-guanylate (m7G) cap that is
important for translation initiation, while the 3' end has a poly-A tail
protecting the mRNA against degradation (Grifo et al., 1983; Wilusz et
al., 2001). Multiple different mRNAs variants (also called isoforms)
from the same genomic region can exist. Isoforms may arise due to
alternave transcription start site usage or a process called alternative
splicing. Isoforms can co-exist at the same time and have differing
properties that can perform distinct functions (Joly Anne-Laure et al.,
2018). Furthermore, alternative splicing may result in in isoforms with
different 5' UTRs. This leads to altered translation of mRNAs encoding
for the same protein (S. N. Floor et al., 2016; Jewer et al., 2020).

\subsection{mRNA translation} \label{translation}

In eukryotes, mRNA translation occurs in the cytoplasm for the vast
majority of protein coding mRNAs. However a small subset of mRNAs
encoded by mitochondrial DNA is translated in the mitochondria (D'Souza
et al., 2018). mRNA translation is a process that consits of several
steps: initiation, elongation, termination and ribosome recycling
(\emph{see figure \ref{fig:doodlemRNASteps}}). These steps will be
discussed in detail below.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{1\textwidth}
  \includegraphics{./figures/doodleTranslation.pdf}
  \caption{mRNA translation initiation, elongation, termination and ribosome recycling steps - The ribosome binds to the mRNA and initiates scanning for a start codon (AUG). The elongation phase incorporates amino acids into a polypeptide chain (i.e. the protein product). Once a stop codon (e.g. UGA) is detected the ribosome terminates translation and releases the polypeptide chain. The ribosome can then be recycled to participate in the translation of another mRNA or reinitiate on the same mRNA. Green ovals represent the 80s ribosome. Within the ribosome the E, P and A-sites are indicated with yellow boxes (see section \ref{elongation} for details. Polypeptide chains are depicted as a series of pink balls. Orange crosses represent transfer RNAs (tRNA) (see section \ref{elongation} and \ref{tRNA} for more details on tRNAs).  \label{fig:doodlemRNASteps}}
\end{wrapfigure}

\clearpage

\subsection{Initiation} \label{initiation}

In eukaryotes, 5' cap-dependent initiation of mRNA translation consists
of multiple stages. First, a ternary complex (TC) consisting of
guanosine-tri-phosphate (GTP) bound eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2
and methionine-initiator transfer RNA (met-tRNAi) is formed. This is
followed by formation of the 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC). The PIC
consists of a 40S ribosome subunit, the TC and, translation iniation
factors eIF1, eIF1A, eIF3, eIF5 (Asano et al., 2000). mRNAs then undergo
``activation''. Here, the 5' cap proximal structure is bound by eIF4F.
eIF4F is the 5' cap binding complex consisting of: the 5' cap binding
protein eIF4E, the RNA helicase eIF4A and, a scaffold protein eIF4G
(Grifo et al., 1983). The Poly (A) binding protein (PABP) binds to the
poly(A) tail of the 3' UTR and causes circularisation of the mRNA. The
circularisation improves stability of the mRNA and aids in recruitment
of translation initiation factors (Ivanov et al., 2016). Upon mRNA
recruitment, the ATP-dependent eIF4A helicase activity of the eIF4F
complex facilitates scanning of 43S PIC along the 5'UTR together with
eIF4B and eIF4H. Recognition of the translation initiation codon (AUG)
induces formation of the 48S initiation complex. Once the initiation
codon (AUGi) is reached, displacement of eIF1 occurs which allows eIF5
to hydrolyse eIF2-bound GTP. The 60S ribosomal subunit then joins the
40S ribosomal subunit which causes the release of eIF2-GDP and other
initiation factors (eIF1, eIF3, eIF4B, eIF4F and eIF5). Subunit joining
is mediated by eIF5B. After subunit joining the 80S ribosome is formed
and the elongation process starts (\emph{see figure \ref{initiation}})
(Asano et al., 2000; Hinnebusch, 2006; Jackson et al., 2010). A
mechanism for cap dependent translation initiation that is independent
of eIF4E has been described. Here, eIF3d binds the 5' cap of mRNAs
containing and RNA element that blocks eIF4E binding (A. S. Y. Lee et
al., 2015,A. S. Y. Lee et al. (2016)). Next to 5'cap-dependent
initiation, mRNA translation can also be initiated in a 5'
cap-independent manner, e.g.~via the internal ribosome entry site (IRES)
(\emph{see figure \ref{fig:UTRFeat}}). Mechanisms for 5' cap-independent
mRNA translation initiation are extensively reviewed elsewhere (Lacerda
et al., 2017; I. N. Shatsky et al., 2018).

\subsection{Elongation} \label{elongation}

The 80S ribosome contains three sites important for decoding an mRNA:
the aminoacyl (A), peptidyl (P) and exit (E) sites. During elongation in
eukaryotes, aminoacytelated tRNAs are delivered to the A-site in a
ternary complex with eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF) 1A and GTP. If
the tRNA is cognate to the codon in the A-site of the ribosome, GTP
bound to eEF1A is hydrolysed. This causes eEF1A to release and
accommodates the aminoacetylated tRNA in the A-site. This is followed by
a peptidyl transferase reaction. This reactions forms the peptide bond
between the peptidyl tRNA in the P-site and amino group of the
aminoacyl-tRNA in the A-site (aa-tRNA) and is catalyzed by 60S ribosomal
subunit. After the peptide bond is formed a translocation step occurs
through eEF2-GTP hydrolysis. The translocation step encompasses that the
deacetylated tRNA currently in the P-site moves into the E-site.
Likewise the peptidyl tRNA in the A-site moves to the P-site. Which
leaves the A-site open for other aminoacyl-tRNAs. The deacytelated tRNA
in the E-site is then released from the ribosome (Dever et al., 2012).
This process is repeated until a stop codon (UAA, UGA or UAG) enters the
A-site of the ribosome.

 \label{fig:polysomes}}
\end{wrapfigure}

mRNA translation termination is facilitated by two eukaryotic release
factors (eRF), eRF1 and eRF3-GTP (E. Z. Alkalaeva et al., 2006; I.
Stansfield et al., 1995). The eRF1:eRF3-GTP complex binds to the A-site
of the ribosome upon recognition of a stop codon. This causes an
hydrolysis event resulting in a conformational change and release of the
polypeptide chain. eRF1 and the ATP binding cassette protein (ABCE1)
together promote the splitting of the 60S and 40S subunits after which
they can be recycled (Hellen, 2018; Pisarev et al., 2010).

\subsection{Translation efficiency}

Each ribosome synthesises a single protein during translation of an mRNA
assuming it is not prematurely terminated. It has been known since the
'60s that translation of an mRNA occurs via multiple bound ribosomes
(polysomes) simultaneaously (\emph{see figure \ref{fig:polysomes}A-C})
(Staehelin et al., 1963; Warner et al., 1962). Therefore the translation
efficiency of an mRNA depends on the number of ribosomes it is
associated with. Experimental methods like polysome profiling and
ribosome profiling are used to study translation efficiencies
(\emph{explained in detail in section \ref{exptMethod}}). While all
steps of translation can affect the translation efficiency of an mRNA,
it is thought to most commonly be regulated at the initiation step
(Dever et al., 2012; Jackson et al., 2010; J. D. Richter et al., 2015).
This is supported by findings using polysome profiling in yeast that was
cultured in nutrient rich medium where initiation was rate-limiting for
most mRNAs (Arava et al., 2003). Furthermore, a recent ribosome
profiling study assessed transcriptome-wide elongation rates. This
revealed a similar rate of elongation for mRNAs of different classes.
These classes were a stratification of mRNAs based on their UTRs or
codon composition of the coding sequence (Ingolia et al., 2011). The
next section will go further into detail how translation initiation and
elongation can be regulated. \newline
\section{Regulation of mRNA translation} \label{regmRNA}

mRNA translation is the most energy consuming process in the cell. In a
study using concanavalin A stimulated rat thymocytes, it was estimated
that translation accounts for \textasciitilde{}20\% of the cellular
energy consumption (Buttgereit et al., 1995). The high energy
consumption of mRNA translation and its central role in the gene
expression pathway requires it to be tightly regulated.

Regulation of translation can be exerted at a global level,
i.e.~regulation of a large set of mRNA simultaneously. Global regulation
of mRNA translation can be achieved by, e.g.~perturbations of major
signalling pathways impinging on mRNA translation. A strong feature of
regulation of mRNA translation is that it can affect specific mRNA
populations selectively. Selective translational regulation acts on
characteristics of mRNAs, e.g.~through 5' UTRs or RNA binding proteins
(RBP) that bind to the 3' UTRs (\textbf{see figure \ref{fig:UTRFeat}})
(Leppek et al., 2018). Furthermore, regulation of initiation factors can
also regulate translation selectively (Wolfe et al., 2014,Gandin et al.
(2016)). Below we will discuss multiple mechanisms that regulate mRNA
translation globally or selectively.

\subsection{mTOR} \label{mTOR}

mTOR is a conserved Ser/Thr kinase and is found in two structurally and
functionally distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2 (Pearce et al., 2007;
Saxton et al., 2017). In a growth promoting environment mTOR regulates
cell metabolism to increase protein synthesis, lipids and nucleotides,
while suppressing catabolic pathways, e.g.~autophagy. mTORC2 promotes
survival via signalling through protein kinase A (AKT), anabolic
metabolism, and cytoskeleton regulation (Sarbassov et al., 2005,Zoncu et
al. (2011)).

mTORC1 activity is modulated via hormone and growth factor signalling,
e.g.~insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF1). This signalling is
predominantly mediated through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) /
AKT pathway. PI3K activation generates
phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3). Phosphatase and tensin
homologue (PTEN) can counteract this by hydrolsis of PIP3 to
phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). PIP3 recruits
phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and AKT to the plasma
membrane. At the plasma membrane AKT is activated through
phosphorylation of PDK1. AKT in turn increases activity towards its
substrate tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). TSC consists of a scaffold
protein, TSC1, and a GTPase, TSC2. TSC negativeley regulates mTORC1
activity. This negative regulation occurs through hydrolsis of Ras
homologue enriched in brain (Rheb) that leads to its inactivation. Rheb
binds to mTOR to promote its activity (\emph{see Figure
\ref{fig:mtorsignal}}). Furthermore, several cross-talk mechanism with
other pathways (e.g.~RAS/ERK) have been shown to lead to mTORC1
activation (reviewed in (Reuben J. Shaw et al., 2006)). The mechanisms
of mTORC2 activation are less well understood.

The PI3K pathway is involved in oncogenic signalling and under
investigation as therapeutic target in cancer (Hilger et al., 2002; J.
Yang et al., 2019). In several cancers (e.g.~breast, lung, prostate and
colon) the gene encoding the catalytic p110\(\alpha\) subunit of PI3K
(PI3KCA) is frequently mutated or amplified (J. W. Lee et al., 2005; D.
A. Levine et al., 2005; Samuels et al., 2004). The E545K mutation leads
to a reduced inhibitory effect of the regulatory p85 subunit on PI3KCA.
In \textbf{study 3}, we investigate oncogenic signalling via the PI3K
pathway activated by insulin. Here, were focus on the role of mTOR in
mediating the effects of insulin on gene expression in the MCF7 breast
cancer cell line that harbours the E545K mutation (Schneck et al.,
2013). Hyperactivity of PI3K/AKT signalling has been reported in
multiple cancers and has been linked to anti-cancer therapy resistance
(P√≥pulo et al., 2012; Salaroglio et al., 2019; Tan et al., 2013).
Furthermore, both PTEN and the TSC act as tumour suppressors and are
frequently mutated in cancer (Mak et al., 2004; M. S. Song et al.,
2012). Therefore, mTOR has become a focus of anti-cancer therapy by
either targeting mTORC1 or using dual inhibitors for PI3K and mTOR (Bhat
et al., 2015). \clearpage

\begin{figure}[ht]

 \label{fig:mtorsignal}}
\end{figure}

mTOR also fulfills a central role in metabolic signalling. Here, mTOR
integrates signals arising through amino acid availability, glucose
metabolism and cellular oxygen levels. For example, increased amino acid
availability induces relocalisation of mTOR into proximity of Rag
GTPases leading to its activation through Rheb (Sancak et al., 2008).
Furthermore, Glucose deprivation leads to increased
adenosine-mono-phosphate kinase (AMPK) signalling via phosphorylation of
serine/threonine kinase 11 (LKB1) (Kimball, 2006; M. J. Sanders et al.,
2007; R. J. Shaw, 2009). In turn, AMPK phosphorylates TSC2 leading to
its activation (Kimball, 2006). LKB1 mutations have been found in cancer
and are being considered as targets in anti-cancer therapy (R.-X. Zhao
et al., 2014). Hypoxia also inhibits mTOR via regulated in development
and DNA damage response 1 (REDD1) which stabilises the TSC (Brugarolas
et al., 2004). While hypoxia (i.e.~deprivation of oxygen) inhibits
protein synthesis in normal cells, in breast cancer, protein synthesis
appeared not to be significantly inhibited during hypoxia which is
attributed to uncontrolled mTOR signalling (Connolly et al., 2006).

In cancer, cellular metabolism, proliferation as well as growth are
often dysregulated (Hanahan et al., 2011). Given the central of mTOR
governing proliferation, growth and metabolism it is vital to
comprehensively understand mTOR signalling in this disease (P. P. Roux
et al., 2018).

\subsubsection{Global regulation of translation via mTOR}

Well studied downstream targets of mTOR for the regulation of mRNA
translation are 4E-binding proteins (4E-BP) and ribosomal protein S6
kinases (S6Ks). mTOR phosphorylates 4E-BP leading to the release of
eIF4E that then can engange in eIF4F complex formation (A.-C. Gingras et
al., 1999). Therefore, inhibition of mTOR leads to a down regulation of
5' cap-dependent mRNA translation.

S6Ks have been shown to regulate phosphorylation of multiple components
of the translation machinery, e.g.~ribosomal protein S6 (rpS6),
programmed cell death protein 4 (PDCD4), eEF2 kinase and eIF4B. S6K
phosphorylates rpS6 which has been implicated in the regulation of
cellular growth and protein synthesis (Ruvinsky et al., 2005).
Furthermore, S6K/rpS6 signalling was suggested to be involed in ribosome
biogenesis. Another S6K target is eEF2 kinase which phosphorylates and
inhibits eEF2, thus attenuating elongation rates. (X. Wang et al.,
2001). MTORC1 phosphorylates and inhibits eEF2K either directly or via
S6Ks. Furthermore, phosphorylation of PDCD4 by S6K triggers its
degradation. PDCD4 blocks eIF4G-eIF4A interactions repressing eIF4A
activity and cap-dependent mRNA translation (Dorrello et al., 2006; A.
G√∂ke et al., 2002). Lastly, phosphorylation of eIF4B by S6K is suggest
to stimulate the unwinding activity of eIF4A (Rogers et al., 2001).

Collectively, through acting on its downstream targets, mTOR regulates
translation globally via a number of mechanisms.

\subsubsection{Selective or "mTOR sensitive" regulation of translation}

\paragraph{Terminal oligo pyrmidine mRNAs}

Selective or ``mTOR sensitive'' regulation of translation can act on
transcripts with a terminal oligo pyrimidine motif (TOP mRNAs). This TOP
motif consists of a C followed by a stretch of 4-15 pyrimidines directly
after the 5' cap. TOP mRNAs show near complete dissociation from
ribosomes under conditions when mTOR is inhibited and are enriched for
genes encoding for components of the translation machinery (Meyuhas,
2000; Thoreen et al., 2012; Yamashita et al., 2008). Recent works
indicate the importance of La ribonucleoprotein domain family member 1
(LARP1) in regulation of TOP mRNAs with contradictory findings (B. D.
Fonseca et al., 2015; Hopkins et al., 2016; Jia et al., 2021; Maraia et
al., 2017). A panel of researches were asked to evaluate these findings
which led to the establishment of a model for translational regulation
via LARP1 (Berman et al., 2021). Herein, LARP1 binds to the 5' mRNA cap
of TOP mRNAs via its DM15 domain. Binding of DM15 represses translation
of TOP mRNAs by obstructing eIF4E binding. This binding occurs in
instances where mTOR activity is abolished. In environments where mTOR
is active, phosphorylation of the DM15 occurs by mTOR. This causes DM15
to release the 5' cap. However, the la domain of LARP1 which is bound to
the 3' UTR remains. The still bound la domain stabileses the mRNA to
facilitate translation (Berman et al., 2021). Other instances of
selective translation by mTOR are explained in the next section.

\paragraph{Selective regulation through members of the eIF4F complex} \label{sel4F}

As mentioned above, the eIF4F complex consists of eIF4E, eIF4A and eIF4G
and is required for cap dependent mRNA translation (A. G. Hinnebusch,
2014). The availability of the eIF4F complex is normally limited due to
that eIF4E is bound by 4E-BPs. Therefore, under normal conditions mRNAs
must compete for translation. Such competition is affected by
characteristics of 5' UTRs that introduce variation to how well mRNAs
can be translated. Benedetti et. al. derived and expanded on a model for
mRNA competition origally proposed by Lodish (De Benedetti et al., 2004
; Lodish, 1974). Herein, ``strong'' mRNAs are widely expressed and
represent the majority of cellular mRNAs and are characterised by
optimally long and unstructured 5' UTRs, e.g. \(\beta\)-actin. An
optimal 5' UTR length of \textasciitilde{}80 nucleotides was proposed by
Kozak (Kozak, 1987). On the other hand, weak mRNAs show long and
structured 5' UTRs. ``Strong'' mRNAs encode for potent growth and
survival factors, e.g.~c-Myc, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1) and
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Translation of ``strong''
mRNAs would remain effective in conditions where eIF4F complex
availability would be limited. However, ``weak'' mRNAs show sensitivity
to eIF4F availability which is dependent on eIF4E expression (Graff et
al., 2008). Elevated eIF4E expression is common in cancer and drives
malignancy due to selective induction of translation of tumor promoting
mRNAs (De Benedetti et al., 2004).

Studies investigated the effects of eIF4A inhibition on mRNA translation
and the underlying characteristics of eIF4A dependent mRNAs. Therein,
mRNAs that dependent on eIF4A showed characteristics of ``weak'' mRNAs,
i.e.~these mRNAs had long and structured 5' UTRs (Rubio et al., 2014;
Waldron et al., 2018; Wolfe et al., 2014). Stuctural elemenents in the
5' UTRs include classical hairpins formed through Watson-Crick
basepairing (\emph{see Figure \ref{fig:UTRFeat}}) (Leppek et al., 2018).
Other structures using hoogsteen basepairing have also been proposed to
regulate eIF4A dependent mRNA translation (Wolfe et al., 2014). These
structures are called G-quadruplexes and are stable structures formed by
stacking two or more G-tetrads (Kwok et al., 2017). However, whether
G-quadruplexes form in cells is still debated (Biffi et al., 2014; J. U.
Guo et al., 2016; Laguerre et al., 2015; Weldon et al., 2016). Some
predict formation of G-quadruplex structures based on occurrences of
\(GGC_4\) motif repeats in the 5' UTR of mRNAs (Singh et al., 2021;
Wolfe et al., 2014). Indeed, multiple studies report enrichments of
\(GGC_4\) motifs in mRNAs whose translation is dependent on eIF4A
(Modelska et al., 2015; Rubio et al., 2014; Singh et al., 2021; Waldron
et al., 2018). However, Waldron et al. show that \(GCC_4\) motifs fail
to form G-quadruplexes in their reporter mRNA system. The authors
concluded that eIF4A dependence of mRNAs with \(GGC_4\) motifs enriched
in their 5' UTR was likely mediated by classical hairpin-like structures
(Waldron et al., 2018). In addition, in Rubio et. al. one third of eIF4A
dependent mRNAs exhibited multiple 5' UTR variants, while for eIF4A
independent mRNAs this was \textless{} 1\% (Rubio et al., 2014).
Translation of mRNAs with different 5' UTR variants has recently been
implicated to drive cancer cell plasticity towards more ``stem
cell-like'' phenotypes during hypoxia (Jewer et al., 2020). Notable here
is the use of eIF4A inhibitors with different modes of action as a means
to test eIF4A dependency of mRNAs. Hippuristanol inhibits RNA
interaction of selective binding to eIF4A (Bordeleau et al., 2006;
Lindqvist et al., 2008). In contrast rocaglates and its derivatives,
e.g.~silvestrol and CR-1-31-B, clamp eIF4A on polypurine sequences on
the mRNA (Iwasaki et al., 2016).

Recently, a more nuanced picture for translation of mRNAs sensitive to
inhibition of components of the eIF4F complex has been shown (Gandin et
al., 2016). Therein, a comparison of treatments with a mTOR and eIF4A
activity inhibitors was evaluated. This revealed that mTOR sensitve
mRNAs encompass two functionally distinct sets of mRNAs. These sets were
characterised by different 5' UTR features. Here, mRNAs characterised by
long and structured 5' UTRs and endoced for pro surival proteins and
were dependent on both eIF4E and eIF4A (hereafter referred to as
mTOR-eIF4A sensitive). The other subset showed less sensitivity to eIF4A
but more so to eIF4A (here after referred to as mTOR-eIF4E senstive
mRNAs). mTOR-eIF4E sensitive mRNAs encoded for proteins in metabolic
functions. The authors concluded that inhibiton of mTOR-eIF4A dependent
programs would lead to cytotoxic effects. Whereas, inhibition of
mTOR-eIF4E mRNAs would lead to metabolic dormancy and a cytostatic
effect (Gandin et al., 2016).

\subsection{The integrated stress response}

The integrated stress response (ISR) is a pathway activated through
kinases responding to various stress signals. These kinases include
Protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) activated by
misfolded peptides in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER). Heme regulated
eIF2alpha kinase (HRI) activated during oxidative stress. Protein kinase
R (PKR) which is activated in response to certain viral infections by
binding to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). As well as general control
nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) which is activated when cells are deprived of
amino acids (Dmitry E Andreev et al., 2015; Guan et al., 2017; Kapur et
al., 2017; Lemaire et al., 2005; Taniuchi et al., 2016). (\emph{see also
figure \ref{fig:initiation}}).

\subsubsection{Global and selective regulation of translation via the ISR}

Similar to mTOR signalling egulation of translation via the ISR is
achieved at a global and selective level. During the ISR the \(\alpha\)
subunit of eIF2 is phosphorylated. Phosphorylated eIF2\(\alpha\)
directly engages the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B and
prevents conversion of inactive eIF2-GDP to active eIF2-GTP needed for
met-tRNAi incorporation in the TC. This reduces TC availability and
causes a global downregulation of mRNA translation (Sonenberg et al.,
2009) While global translation is reduced upon ISR, translation of a
selective subset of mRNA with upstream open reading frames (uORFs) is
increased. A uORF is a reading frame that originates in the 5' UTR of an
mRNA upstream of the coding sequence ORF (cdsORF) (\emph{see Figure
\ref{fig:UTRFeat}}). uORFs can be out of frame with the cdsORF and, when
translated, lower the expression of the cdsORF (Kozak, 1984). Activating
transcription factor 4 (ATF4), that regulates expression of stress
response genes, contains multiple uORFs of which one partially overlaps
with the cdsORF. Under normal conditions ATF4 translation is initiated
at uORF1 and reinitiation at uORF2 occurs. The overlap of uORF2 with the
cdsORF causes ribosomes to synthesise protein from uORF2 thereby
inhibiting the translation of the coding sequence. Limitation of TC
availability during ISR causes longer ribosome scanning times leading to
that ribosomes scan past uORF2 and initiate at the cdsORF (i.e.~delayed
reinitiation) (Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016).

Ribosome profiling studies indicate that 50\% of mammalian mRNAs harbour
uORFs (\emph{see section \ref{exptMethod} for detials on ribosome
profiling}). mRNAs containing uORFs include oncogenes and transcripts
important in differentiation and cell cycle (Calvo et al., 2009; Ingolia
et al., 2011). Apart from delayed reinitiation, uORF translation can
also be due to ``leaky scanning''. The surrounding sequence of the uORF
is important for initiation of translation. An AUG in the classical
Kozak context (i.e.~RNN\textbf{AUG}G) is most efficient for translation
initiation due to better recognition by the met-tRNAi (Calvo et al.,
2009; Kozak, 1986). Unfavored flanking sequences of the AUG can cause
the ribosome to scan past the AUG, this process is called ``leaky
scanning''. An example of this is DNA-inducible gene 34 (GADD34) which
increases its translation upon ER stress, i.e.~a condition where
eIF2\(\alpha\) is phosphorylated. In humans, GADD34 contains two uORFs
separated by 30 nucleotides (Y.-Y. Lee et al., 2009). In contrast to the
uORFs in ATF4, the uORFs in GADD34 are to close together to promote
reinitiation. Under basal conditions uORF2, which has a poor kozak
context, represses translation of the CDS. However, under stress causing
eIF2\(\alpha\) phosphorylation, ribosomes scan past uORF2 to translate
the CDS (Young et al., 2015). Furthermore, both uORF1 seems to initiate
translation to repress the cdsORF under basal conditions. Lastly,
structural elements in proximity of the uORF can also influence its
translation (H. Ruan et al., 1994).

\subsection{Regulation of mRNA translation by tRNAs} \label{tRNA}\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.6\textwidth}
  \includegraphics{./figures/tRNA.pdf}
  \caption{ Schematic representations of (A) the tRNA cloverleaf structure with indicated anti-codon and amino acid acceptor sites;  (B)  the proliferation and differentiation mRNAs dependent on distinct tRNA subsets; (C) the U34 wobble position and the catalytic enzymes involved in this modification that is implied in tumor progression.
 \label{fig:tRNA}}
\end{wrapfigure}

As touched upon earlier, tRNAs are an essential part of the translation
machinery that carry the amino acids to the ribosome. In eukaryotes,
tRNAs consist of a 76-90 long nucleotide sequence set into a
``cloverleaf'' structure forming several loops (Sharp et al., 1985)
(\textbf{see figure \ref{tRNA}}). The acceptor stem binds the amino acid
carried by the tRNA, while the anti-codon loop binds to the mRNA within
the ribosome via classical watson-crick pairing (Watson et al., 1953).
Multiple codons can encode for the same amino acid (synonymous codons),
however the availability of the tRNAs for different codons may vary
which can influence elongation rates and thus protein synthesis.

This supply ( i.e.~tRNA availability) and demand (i.e.~codon
composition) relationship has been found to vary across different
cellular states, e.g.~proliferation and differentiation. Gingold et. al.
observed two differen tRNA subsets. One subset is induced under
proliferation and is otherwise repressed. And the other subset is
induced under differentiation and repressed otherwise. Both tRNA subsets
match the codon demand of the transcriptome under their respective
cellular state (Gingold et al., 2014). This model has been disputed and
it was proposed that the observed differences would be attributed to GC
content in the mRNA (Rudolph et al., 2016). Nevertheless, abbarent tRNA
expression and codon usage have been reported in cancer (Z. Zhang et
al., 2018). Furthermore, a comprehensive study using small RNAseq
(i.e.~for identification of tRNAs) and protein samples across 17 tissues
reported a tRNA signature stratified by proliferation marker Ki67
staining. The identified tRNA signature has implications for patient
survival (Hernandez-Alias et al., 2020). Therefore, while a consensus on
proliferation specific tRNA subsets might not have been reached,
emerging evidence implicates a role thereof in cancer (Gingold et al.,
2014; Hernandez-Alias et al., 2020; Z. Zhang et al., 2018). For
instance, increased expression of \(tRNA_{CCG}^{Arg}\) and
\(tRNA_{UUC}^{Glu}\) has been observed in breast cancer cell lines and
proposed to drive metastasis (Goodarzi et al., 2016).

Others report of a role of tRNAs in cancer attributed to tRNA
modifications, specifically at the U34 anti- codon (or wobble) position
which is highly conserved (El Yacoubi et al., 2012; Lorent et al., 2019;
Rapino et al., 2017). The ability to wobble was proposed by Francis
Crick and refers to non-Watson-Crick base pairing of tRNA anti-codons
(F. H. Crick, 1966). This enables a smaller set of tRNAs (41-55 in
eukaryotes) to encode for the 64 possible codon combinations (Goodenbour
et al., 2006). In mammals, the U34 modification catalytic cascade
involves the acetyltransferase Elongator (ELP3), the methyltransferase
TRM9-like domain of Alkylation repair homolog 8 (ALKBH8), and the
urmylation (URM) pathway. The URM includes the cytosolic thiouridylase
homolog 1 and 2 (CTU1/CTU2) (Kalhor et al., 2003; Karlsborn et al.,
2014). These enzymes ultimately modify the U34 position into
5-methoxycarbonyl-methyl-2-thiouridine (\(mcm^5s^2U\)) which ensures
cognate codon recognition. This modification is thought to occur in
tRNAs with a U in the wobble position, e.g. \(tRNA^{UUU}\),
\(tRNA^{UUC}\), \(tRNA^{UUG}\), \(tRNA^{UCC}\), and \(tRNA^{UCU}\).

Loss of the ability to modify U34 has been shown to reduce translation
elongation rates with varying effects on protein expression (Deng et
al., 2015; Nedialkova et al., 2015; Zinshteyn et al., 2013). While in
some cases U34 dependent signalling led to ribosome stalling resulting
in protein aggregates and increased stress (Nedialkova et al., 2015;
Zinshteyn et al., 2013), others reported a subtle dowregulation of
proteins encoded by mRNAs requiring U34-modified tRNAs (Deng et al.,
2015). U34 modification dependent tRNAs have been shown to play a role
in cancer. For example, ELP3 is important in tumor initiation in
intestinal epithelia and promotes breast cancer invasion as well as
progression to metastasis (Delaunay et al., 2016; Ladang et al., 2015).

\subsection{RNA binding proteins and trans-acting factors}

The UTRs of an mRNA contain sequence elements to which small RNA and RNA
binding proteins (RBPs) bind and exert translational regulation
(\emph{see figure \ref{fig:UTRFeat}}).

\subsubsection{microRNAs} microRNAs (miRNA) are a class of small
non-coding RNA. The precise role and mechanisms in regulation of
translation by miRNAs is still under active investigation (Oliveto et
al., 2017). However, they can directly bind to other mRNAs and silence
them accomplished through translational repression or destabilisation
{[}Jonas2015{]}. Regulation of gene expression by miRNAs has been
observed in cancer. Here, miRNAs have been implicated to promote
tumorgenesis or act as tumor suppressors (Muniyappa et al., 2009; Nagpal
et al., 2015; Sampson et al., 2007; Tian et al., 2010).

\subsubsection{RNA binding proteins}

RBPs are a class of proteins involved in many regulatory steps of gene
expression and account for \textasciitilde{}7.5\% of the protein coding
genes. RBPs bind to elements in the 3' UTRs, e.g.~the poly (A) tail. One
RBP binding the poly(A) tail is PABP. As explained in \emph{section
\ref{initiation}} PABP is involved in mRNA translation initiation and
stabilisation of the mRNA (Afonina et al., 2014; Amrani et al., 2008)
(\textbf{see also figure \ref{fig:initiation}}).

Another site in the 3' UTR is the U-rich cytoplasmic polyadenylation
(CPE) site to which cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding proteins
(CPEBs) can bind (\emph{see Figure \ref{fig:UTRFeat}}). Studies in
\emph{Xenopus} oocytes indicate that CPEB associates with a
non-canonical poly(A) polymerase (Gld2) and a poly(A) deadynelase
(PARN). PARN has a higher activity than Gld-2 and thus binding of CPEB
to an mRNA leads to shortening of the Poly(A) tail (Barnard et al.,
2004). However, hormonal stimulation leading to CPEB phosphorylation
removes PARN from the complex. Removal of PARN promotes poly(A) tail
elongation through Gld-2 (J. H. Kim et al., 2006). Furthermore, in
\emph{Xenopus} oocytes, CPEB associates with an eIF4E binding protein,
i.e.~maskin. Maskin bound to eIF4E prevents eIF4F complex formation
which represses mRNA translation (Ivshina et al., 2014; Stebbins-Boaz et
al., 1999). Therefore, CPEBs can regulate translation by altering 3' UTR
lengths and are involed in transaltional repression by blocking eIF4A
association with the 5' cap in \emph{Xenopus} oocytes. While the role of
CPEB mediated regulation has been described mostly in \emph{Xenopus}
oocytes, dysregulation of CPEBs has been observed in glioblastoma,
colorectal and pancreatic cancer (Y.-T. Chang et al., 2014;
Ortiz-Zapater et al., 2011; Villanueva et al., 2017).

Another important RBP implicated in regulation of translation is Human
antigen R (HuR). HuR preferentially binds to AU-rich sequences in the 3'
UTR and acts as a stabilising agent and is involved in RNA-processing
(Baou et al., 2011; X. C. Fan et al., 1998; T. D. Levine et al., 1993;
S. S.-Y. Peng et al., 1998). In colorectal carcinoma cells HuR has been
shown to enhance protein synthesis of p53 after exposure to
short-wavelength UV light (UVC) by binding the 3' UTR (Mazan-Mamczarz et
al., 2003). The enhanced effect on protein synthesis was not mediated by
stability as HuR failed to stabilise p53 upon UVC exposure. In human
bone osteosarcoma epithelial cells, overexpression of HuR led to a dose
dependent increase in eIF4E protein levels. The increase in protein
levels was atrributed to eIF4E transcript stabilisation through binding
of HuR to AU-rich elements (AREs) in the 3' UTR of eIF4E (Topisirovic et
al., 2009). Other known drivers of tumor progression targetted by HuR
include hypoxia inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), VEGF, c-Myc (Denkert et al.,
2004; L√≥pez de Silanes et al., 2003, 2005). Furthermore, studies in
breast, colon and lung cancer observed correlation between HuR and
malignancy (Denkert et al., 2004; L√≥pez de Silanes et al., 2003, 2005).

\section{Expertimental methods to measure mRNA translation} \label{exptMethod}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.6\textwidth}
    \includegraphics{./figures/polyRibo.pdf}
  \caption{Polysome profiling and ribosome profiling workflows. In polysome profiling a fraction from whole cytoplasmic RNA is loaded onto a sucrose gradient on which they get separated by sedimentation into the sucrose gradient using ultra centrifugation. Fractions corresponding to efficiently translated mRNAs are collected and can be quantified with for example RNA sequencing (left). During ribosome profiling a fraction from the whole cytoplasmic RNA is exposed to a digestion agent which breaks the RNA. Ribosomes will protect fragments thereby creating ribosome protected fragments. These fragments are then isolated and can be sequenced.  \label{fig:polyRibo}}
\end{wrapfigure}

Two methods are predominantly used for measuring mRNA translation to
estimate changes in translation efficiencies across conditions, namely
polysome profiling and ribosome profiling (\textbf{see figure
\ref{fig:polyRibo}}). These methods capture the number of ribosomes an
mRNA is associated with. The number of bound ribosomes is an adequate
estimator changes in translation efficiencies when initation is rate
limiting. Indeed, as explained above this is a common scenario.

\subsection{Polysome profiling}

Polysome profiling allows for separation of polysomes from monosomes,
ribosomal subunits and messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs).
During the assay, ribosomes are immobilized on the mRNAs using
translation elongation inhibitors, e.g.~cycloheximide (CHX). Cytoplasmic
RNA extracts sediment into a linear sucrose gradient (5-50\%) using
ultra centrifugation. The resulting gradient is fractionated and mRNAs
with different numbers of bound ribosomes can be extracted and analyzed
for changes in translational efficiency (Gandin et al., 2014). Typically
fractions belonging to mRNAs with more than 3 bound ribosomes are
pooled. A 3-ribosome cut off has been chosen as it is thought to capture
most biologically relevant changes in translation efficiency (Gandin et
al., 2016).

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.6\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{./figures/polysome_shifts.pdf}
  \caption{Polysome profliles -  (top left) Schematic representation of a polysome profile using linear sucrose gradient fractionation. Indicated in the polysome profiles are the 40S, 60S ribosomal subunits as well as the 80S monosome. H.P. indicates heavy polysome fractions.Between conditions (i.e. black an pink lines) distribution changes for mRNA abundance (grey and green; top right), translation (grey and red; bottom left) and translation within high polysome fractions (grey and red; bottom right) are illustrated. \label{fig:polysome}}
\end{wrapfigure}

An illustration of a polysome profile with peaks for the 40S, 60S
subunits and 80S ribosome can be seen in (\textbf{Fig \ref{fig:polysome}
top left}). Subsequent peaks along the frations indicate the mRNAs with
2 or more bound ribosomes. mRNAs are typically normally distributed
along the fractions, i.e.~in a pool of the same mRNA many will be
associated with different numbers of ribosomes (Gandin et al., 2016).
Changes in mRNA abundance may lead to an overall increase in the amount
of isolated polysome-associated mRNA without a shift of the distribution
along the fractions (\textbf{Fig \ref{fig:polysome} top right}). This
means that the translation efficiency per mRNA remains unchanged.
Changes in translational efficiency can be observed by shifts along the
polysome fractions. For example, if the mRNA shift from the light
(inefficiently translated) towards the heavy (efficiently translated)
polysome fractions or vice versa in the absence of changes in total mRNA
levels (\textbf{Fig \ref{fig:polysome} bottom left}). Shifts within the
heavy polysome fractions (i.e.~with a mean distribution around 4 bound
ribosomes to 7 bound ribosomes) can also occur (\textbf{Fig
\ref{fig:polysome} bottom right}). Quantification of mRNA levels within
each fraction can be assessed using Northern blotting or reverse
transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). For
transcriptome-wide studies efficiently translated mRNAs are pooled and
quantified using either DNA-microarrays or RNA sequencing.

Pooling of mRNAs as well as collection of multiple fractions makes
polysome profiling inconvenient when dealing experiments with low
amounts of input RNA or with large samples sizes. Therefore, an
optimized sucrose gradient was developed where mRNAs bound to
\textgreater{}3 ribosomes are collected on a sucrose cushion and thereby
can be isolated from one single fraction (Liang et al., 2018). This
optimized gradient allows for application of polysome profiling in small
tissue samples where RNA quantity is limiting and reduces labor
intensity of the assay.

Polysome-associated mRNA levels are subject to changes in translation
efficiency as well as factors contributing to cytosolic mRNA levels that
impact to pool of mRNAs that can associate with ribosomes
e.g.~transcription and mRNA stability. Therefore, to identify true
changes in translation efficiency it is important to collect cytoplasmic
mRNA and polysome-associated mRNA from the same sample in parallel to
correct for such mechanisms during downstream analysis.

\subsection{Ribosome profiling} \label{riboseq}

For R17 bacteriophage ribosome protected RNA fragments (RPFs) have been
obtained in the 1960s using ribonucleosases to trim away mRNA sequences
not protected by ribosomes (J. A. Steitz, 1969). More recently ribosome
profiling has been developed. Ribosome profling enables sequencing of
RPFs on a transcriptome-wide scale (Ingolia, 2016; Ingolia et al.,
2009). Similar to polysome profiling. in the ribosome profiling assay
ribosomes are immobilised on mRNAs using translation elongations
inhibitors (e.g.~CHX).

RPFs are obtained by RNAse treatment that degrades the links of RNA
between ribosomes leaving single ribosomes with a \textasciitilde{}28
nucleotide long RNA fragment within each ribosome. However, as ribosomal
RNAs (rRNA) are also degraded during this process they represent a big
fraction herein. The RPFs are then isolated using ultra centrifugation
through a sucrose cushion. During this step other RNA fragments such as
rRNAs, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) or large ribonucleoprotein complexes can
co-migrate and contaminate the sample. Typically RPFs with a size
ranging from 25-30 nucleotides are selected for quantification. However,
among these sizes could be RNA protected by RBPs that have no ribosome
associated to it. Furthermore, ribosomes undergoing conformational
changes have been shown to protect fragments corresponding to a length
of 21nt when translation elongation is blocked by e.g.~CHX (L. F. Lareau
et al., 2014). Therefore, size selection can distort the estimation of
translation efficiency from ribosome profiling data (Dmitry E. Andreev
et al., 2017). From the resulting RPFs libraries can be constructed and
quantified using RNA sequencing. During library construction additional
biases due to enzyme sequence preferences can be introduced that can
lead wrong estimations of codon positions within the ribosome (Artieri
et al., 2014a).

Recently, Ribo-seq Unit Step Transformation (RUST) has been developed
(O'Connor et al., 2016). This algorithm can reveal mRNA sequence
features affecting RPF density globally. The authors applied RUST to 30
publicly available data sets and identified substanial sequence
heterogeneity affecting RPF densities. Thus, sequence bias is prominent
in ribosome profiling data (O'Connor et al., 2016).

Initially, fragmented total mRNA using alkaline hydrolysis of the same
size were retrieved in paralell to RPFs. This was achieved by extraction
of total mRNA from cell lysate followed by purification via recovery of
polyadenylated messages or removal of ribosomal RNA (Brar et al., 2015;
Ingolia et al., 2009). The random fragmentation of total mRNA has been
shown to underlie experimental bias. Therefore, now sequencing of
unfragmented total mRNA in parallel is preferred.

\subsection{Comparing ribosome and polysome profiling}

Albeit both methods generate count data after quantification with RNA
sequencing, there are some key aspects that differ between the
techniques. Polysome profiling separates efficiently translated mRNAs
from non- efficiently translated mRNAs along a sucrose gradient thereby
creating an mRNA based perspective for analysing changes in
translational efficiencies. In contrast, ribosome profiling determines
translational efficiencies by counting the number of RPFs of both
efficiently and non-efficiently translated mRNAs. This can have
implications for identifaction of transcript variants. For example, if a
ribosome would not protect a fragment spanning a variant deducing site
the information would be lost during ribosome profiling (S. N. Floor et
al., 2016). Whereas in polysome profiling the quantification is based on
the whole mRNA. This gives polysome profiling the advantage in cases
where transcript variants with different 5' UTR lengths are of interest.

Shifts in ribosome association can be dramatic (e.g.~near complete
dissociation of ribosomes from an mRNA) or subtle (e.g.~shifts from 2 to
4 ribosomes). Such different shifts be due to different properties of
the mRNAs (Gandin et al., 2016). When dramatic and subtle changes in
ribosome association are present in parallel, ribosome profiling is
biased towards identification of dramatic shifts and masks the subtle
ones (Gandin et al., 2016). Gandin et. al. showed under mTOR inhibition
ribosome profiling studies would predominantly identify TOP mRNAs
(i.e.~heavy shifters). In contrast, polysome profiling identified both
TOP and non-TOP mRNAs when mTOR is inhibited (Gandin et al., 2016).
Therefore, in scenarios where global mRNA translation is affected,
application of ribosome profiling could lead to imprecise biological
conclusions. The masking of subtle changes has been attrituted to the
indirect estimation of translation efficiencies from counting RPFs for
ribosome profiling, which is highly dependent on the abundance of mRNAs.
In polysome profiling this effect is much less pronounced as changes in
translation efficiency are directly estimated from the mRNAs associated
with heavy polysomes (Masvidal et al., 2017). Therefore, polysome
profiling is more suitable in studies that aim to analyse global changes
in translation efficiences. (Gandin et al., 2016; Masvidal et al.,
2017).

An advantage of ribosome profiling is that it provides exact nucleotide
positions occupied by ribosomes. This offers information at a single
nucleotide level where the ribosome is located at the mRNA. Polysome
profiling cannot reveal ribosome locations along the mRNA. The single
nucleotide resolution of ribosome profiling is necessary in contexts
studying events such as ribosomal frame shifts or uORF translation
(Dmitry E Andreev et al., 2015; Rato et al., 2011). One limitation of
ribosome profiling to identify features such as uORFs, is the use of
elongation inhibitors in the protocol, e.g.~CHX. After CHX treatment
elongation is not immediatly inhibited but continues for several cycles
(Hussmann et al., 2015). Studies investigating stress in yeast showed
that increases in ribosome occupancy were due to CHX treatment rather
than stress (Gerashchenko et al., 2014). Therefore, CHX treatment can
introduce biases in ribosome profiling obscuring indentification of
sequence features that are potentially important for translational
regulation (Gerashchenko et al., 2014; Hussmann et al., 2015).

Both methods have their strengths and weaknesses. Thus, when designing
an experiment each method should be considered and chosen depending on
the underlying biological question. \newline
\section{Modes for regulation of gene expression through mRNA translation} \label{modes}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.6\textwidth}
  \includegraphics{./figures/geneModes_MRNA.pdf}
  \caption{Modes for regulation of gene expression - Schematic representation of modes by which mRNA translation regulates gene expression in a fold-change scatter plot. Indicated in red are changes in translation (i.e. changes in translated mRNA but not total mRNA), in green changes in mRNA abundance (i.e. congruent changes between total mRNA and translated mRNA) and in blue translational buffering (i.e. changes in total mRNA levels but not translated mRNA levels). TE changes as the TE-score would estimate them are indicated.\label{fig:modes}}
\end{wrapfigure}

From transcriptome-wide assessments of translation using ribosome or
polysome profiling expression levels are obtained for both cytoplasmic
and polysome-associated mRNAs (or RPFs). For simplicity, from now on,
these RNA types will be referred to as total mRNA (i.e.~cytoplasmic
mRNA) and translated mRNA (i.e.~polysome-associated mRNA or RPFs). The
estimation of expression levels for both translated mRNA and total mRNA
allows for interrogation at two steps of the gene expression pathway as
well as their interaction. The interplay of total mRNA with translated
mRNA can give valuable insights about the underlying mechanisms that
govern gene expression in the studied system.

When comparing perturbed systems to their corresponding control state
three ``modes'' in which translated mRNA and total mRNA distinctly
interact can be observed (\emph{see figure \ref{modes}}). We refer to
these modes as ``mRNA abundance'', ``translation'' (i.e.~changes in
translation efficiencies leading to altered protein levels) and,
``translational buffering'' (i.e.~changes in translation efficiencies
ensuring protein homeostasis).

\subsection{mRNA Abundance}

A change in mRNA abundance is observed when the translated mRNA level
changes to a similar magnitude as the total mRNA level (\emph{see figure
\ref{modes}}). For these mRNAs the translation efficiency is unaltered,
as the change in total mRNA levels explains the change in translated
mRNA levels. This is in line with the model of ``weak'' and ``strong''
mRNAs where the abundance of mRNAs alters the ability to compete for
translation initiation factors. The underlying biological implications
for this mode are often related to transcription or mRNA stability.
While genes of the mRNA abundance mode do not change their translation
efficiency, the change in overall translation is expected to reshape the
proteome.

\subsection{Translation}

A change in translation occurs when translated mRNA levels either
increase or decrease, while corresponding total mRNA levels remain
constant or change to a lesser extent (\emph{see figure \ref{modes}}).
The change in ribosome association indepedent of total mRNA levels is
therefore a change in their translation efficiency. A prominent example
of this mode can be observed for TOP mRNAs. Under conditions when mTOR
is inhibited, TOP mRNAs show a near complete dissassociation from
ribosomes (Gandin et al., 2016). Furthermore, during the ISR,
translation of ATF4 is altered due to eIF2\(\alpha\) phosphorylation.
Similar to changes in mRNA abundance, mRNAs under the translation mode
are expected to reshape the proteome (\emph{see figure \ref{modes}}).

\subsection{Translational buffering} \label{modeBuffering}

The third mode of regulation of gene expression is termed translational
buffering. Under this mode, a change in total mRNA levels is observed,
whereas polysome-associated mRNA levels remain constant between
conditions. Translational buffering also reflects a change in
translation efficiency as the proportion of mRNAs associated with
ribosomes is altered. Notable, the change in translation efficiency upon
translational buffering (i.e.~ribosome associated is unaltered) is
distinct to that from changes in translation where ribosome association
is explicitly modulated. In contrast to changes in translation and mRNA
abundance, translational buffering has been shown to maintain protein
homeostasis rather than reshape the proteome (\emph{See figure
\ref{modes}}) (Lorent et al., 2019; McManus et al., 2014).

Current literature supports multiple forms of translational buffering.
Translational buffering can compensate for differences in mRNA levels
due to e.g.~differences in gene dosages, so that protein levels remain
similar (Dassi et al., 2015; Lalanne et al., 2018). Furthermore, rather
than compensating it can ``offset'' modulations of total mRNA levels at
the level of translation to temporarily alter the mRNA:protein ratio
(Lorent et al., 2019).

Translational buffering in its compensation form has been observed at
steady state levels. A study comparing co-evolution of transcription and
translation across seven different organs and mammals showed overall
greater divergence of transcription as compared to translation (Z.-Y.
Wang et al., 2020). Similar compensation at the level of translation has
been observed between individuals, tissues and prokaryotes (Artieri et
al., 2014b; C. Cenik et al., 2015; Dassi et al., 2015; Lalanne et al.,
2018; Perl et al., 2017).

Compensation via translational buffering can also enforce equilibration
of pathway or protein complex stoichometry (Lalanne et al., 2018; Li et
al., 2014). An example of this was observed in evolutionary distant
bacetria, i.e. \emph{B. subtilis} and \emph{E. coli}. In \emph{B.
subtilis} translation related factors rpsP and rplS are located in
different operons, whereas in \emph{E. coli} they lie within an operon
together with rimM and trmD. While \emph{B. subtilis} can fine tune
transcription at the different operons, in \emph{E. coli} these will be
transcribed together. However, in \emph{E. coli} rimM and trmD are only
needed in low protein abundance, whereas rpsP and rplS are required in
high abundance. \emph{E. coli} compensates the transcriptional input at
the translational level and thus equilibriates for requirements in
pathway stoichometry (Lalanne et al., 2018).

As mentioned above, a different form of translational buffering can be
observed in perturbed systems that offset changes in total mRNA levels
at the level of translation temporarily. For example, translational
offsetting was observed in prostate cancer cells where a transcriptional
program was induced under estrogen receptor \(\alpha\) (ER\(\alpha\))
depletion that showed no increase in polysome-associated mRNA. mRNAs
whose transcription was translationally offset required the tRNA u34
modification. ER\(\alpha\) has been shown to regulate the expression of
the catalytic enzymes required for the u34 modification (Lorent et al.,
2019). Thus, depletion of ER\(\alpha\) led to that tRNAs could not be
properly modified at the U34 position. Therefore the translation
efficiency of mRNAs requiring the modification was reduced despite
increased total mRNA levels. The authors confirmed that protein levels
of translationally offset mRNAs were unaltered between conditions
(Lorent et al., 2019). \newline
\section{Algorithms for analysis of changes in translation efficiencies}\label{algorithm}

As discussed above, mRNA translation can reshape the proteome via
multiple modes for regulation of gene expression. Furthermore, these
modes can have different underlying biological mechanisms. It is
therefore warrented to distinguish them in analysis of translation
efficienies. In this section discusses methods to analyse
polysome-profiling and ribosome profiling data to estimate changes in
translation efficiencies across 2 or more conditions.

Initially analysis of transcriptome-wide translation studies used an
approach called the translation efficiency score (TE-score) that uses
the following equation:
\[\varDelta TE = \frac{\frac{P_{c2}}{T_{c2}}} {\frac{P_{c1}}{T_{c1}}}\\\]

This score calculates the ratio of the ratios between
polysome-associated mRNA levels (P) divided by total mRNA levels (T)
within each condition, i.e.~C1 and C2. The TE- score approach has been
shown to be prone to spurious correlations (Larsson et al., 2010).
Spurious correlations arise due to that the ratio of polysome-associated
mRNA and total mRNA can systematically correlate with total mRNA levels
which is not corrected for in this equation and leads to an elevated
type-1 error.

\emph{Figure \ref{fig:TE}} gives an overview of the relationship between
a change in TE-score and each gene expression mode (\emph{see also
figure \ref{fig:modes}}). Changes in mRNA abundance will lead to a
\(\varDelta\)TE close to 0 in log space (i.e.~no change in translation
efficiency). This is due to that total mRNA and translated mRNA change
with a similar magnitude. However, in the case of both translation and
translational buffering, the nominator and denominator in the TE-score
equation change leading to a \(\varDelta\)TE (TE \textless{} 0 or TE
\textgreater{} 0). This leads to identification of both changes in
translation and translational buffering simultaneously. Therefore, the
TE-score method fails to differentiate between changes in translation
and translational buffering which can have drastic consequences for the
biological interpretation of the results (\textbf{see also section
\ref{modes}}). \clearpage

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{0.5\textwidth}
  \includegraphics{./figures/geneModes_TE.pdf}
  \caption{TE-scores for modes for regulation of gene expression -  Schematic representation of modes for regulation of gene expression in a fold-change scatter plot. The x-axis indicates the fold-change for total mRNA levels. The y-axis indicates the fold-change for translated mRNA levels. Indicated in red are changes in translation efficiency altering protein levels, in green changes in mRNA abundance and in blue changes in translation efficiency leading to translational buffering/offsetting. The relationship for the TE-score and the modes for regulation of gene expression is indicated. \label{fig:TE}}
\end{wrapfigure}

The TE-score approach was questioned when proposing the Analysis of
Translation Activity (anota) algorithm which was developed for
DNA-microarray data (Larsson et al., 2010). Anota combines analysis of
partial variance (APV) (Schleifer et al., 1993) with a random variance
model (RVM) (G. W. Wright et al., 2003). RVM estimates gene variance
using shared information across all genes to increase power for
detection of differential expression (G. W. Wright et al., 2003). Anota
uses a two-step process that firstly assesses the model assumptions for
(i) absence of highly influential data points, (ii) samples classes
sharing a common slope, (iii) homoscedasticity of residuals and (iv)
normal distribution of per gene residuals. In the second step anota
performs analysis of changes in translational activity using the
following model:

\[y_{gi} = \beta_g^{RNA}\ X_i^{RNA}+ \beta_g^{cond}\ X_i^{cond} + \varepsilon_{gi}\]

here \(y_{gi}\) is the polysome associated mRNA expression,
\(\beta_g^{RNA}\) describes the relationship to total RNA for the
\(gth\) gene of the \(ith\) sample column of model matrix \(X\);
\(\beta_g^{cond}\) represent the difference in intercept between
treatment classes and \(\varepsilon_{gi}\) denotes the residual error.
\clearpage

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{0.5\textwidth}
  \includegraphics{./figures/geneModes_anota_Larsson.pdf}
  \caption{anota gene models - Schematic representation of the anota analysis models. Translated mRNA expression is set out against total mRNA expression for each biological replicate and treatment condition. Top left shows the model of a gene that is differentially translated (i.e. change in translated but not total mRNA). The difference in the slope intercepts are used to estimate changes in translation efficiencies between conditions. Other gene models are shown; change in translation efficiency with varying total mRNA levels (top right); change in mRNA abundance (bottom left) and translational buffering (bottom right).
  \label{fig:anota}}
\end{wrapfigure}

Within anota a common slope for the treatment classes that describes the
relationship between translated mRNA and total mRNA is calculated. The
difference between the slope intercepts is then interpreted as the
change in translation efficiency. A simplified view of this model is
provided in (\emph{Figure \ref{fig:anota} top left}). Here expression
for translated mRNA and total mRNA are modeled over two sample classes
that each has 4 replicates. Changes in translation efficiencies can also
be observed when translated mRNA expression is modulated to a larger
extent than the total mRNA levels (\emph{Figure \ref{fig:anota} top
right}). Identification of genes in this category can be a challenge,
especially in highly variable data sets, as they resemble mRNA abundance
genes (\emph{Figure \ref{fig:anota} bottom left}). Nevertheless, using
the linear regression analysis anota accurately corrects changes in
translated mRNA as can be seen in (\emph{Figure \ref{fig:anota} bottom
right}). Here, a change in total mRNA but not translated mRNA levels is
observed. For this gene, the difference in slope intercepts between
sample classes is small and will not be identified as differentially
translated as would be the case in the TE-score approach. Anota was
developed at a time where translational buffering was not considered in
data sets. Naturally, the method lacks a setting to analyse
translational buffering. This was addressed in anota's successor,
anota2seq, and will be discussed in \emph{Study 1}.

Advances in experimental methods warrant for appropriate statistical
approaches to analyse data resulting from them. DNA-microarray was the
dominant platform to assess transcriptome-wide changes before the advent
of RNA sequencing. DNA-microarrays measure intensity after hybridisation
events which is an indicator of expression. In contrast, in RNA
sequencing reads of constructed libraries are counted. Intensity data
from DNA-microarray can be normalised and transformed (i.e.~log
transformation) to fulfill the requirements for application of linear
models, whereas RNA sequencing harbours additional characteristics that
need to be accounted for. Therefore, algorithms developed for analysis
of DNA- microarray are not directly applicable to RNA sequencing data as
is the case for the anota algorithm.

RNA sequencing data shows variance that is greater than the mean which
is commonly referred to as overdispersion. Count data from RNA
sequencing have been initially approached using Poisson distributions
which assumes that the variance is equal to the mean (J. Lu et al.,
2005). Now established RNA sequencing analysis frameworks such as edgeR
and DESeq2 use negative binomial distributions in combination with
generalised linear models (GLMs) (Love et al., 2014; Robinson et al.,
2010). The negative binomial distribution uses a dispersion parameter to
account for differences in the mean-variance relationship across the
expression range (McCarthy et al., 2012). While analysis principles of
DESeq2 and edgeR are similar they differ in their normalisation method,
dispersion estimation and information sharing across genes. In a simple
differential expression analysis between two conditions with one RNA
type the GLM model would be as in the following equation:

\[log(y_{gi}) = \beta_g^{cond}\ X_i^{cond} + \varepsilon_{gi}\]

here \(\beta_g^{cond}\ X_i^{cond}\) represent the condition
(i.e.~control and treatment) log2 fold change for the \(gth\) gene
\(ith\) sample column of the model matrix X and \(\varepsilon_{gi}\)
denotes the residual error. When analysing changes in translation
effiencies additional parameters for RNA type (i.e.~total mRNA or
translated mRNA) and the interaction between the RNA type and condition
are added so that:

\[log(y_{gi}) = \beta_g^{RNA}\ X_i^{RNA}+ \beta_g^{cond}\ X_i^{cond} + \beta_g^{RNA:cond}\ X_i^{interaction} + \varepsilon_gi\]

In this model, the interaction term is interpreted as the change in
translation effiencies (Chothani et al., 2019). Other methods
(i.e.~Ribodiff (Zhong et al., 2017), Riborex (W. Li et al., 2017) and
deltaTE (Chothani et al., 2019)) borrow this analysis principle of an
GLM with an interaction term by applying this exact model. A notable
difference is that Ribodiff allows dispersion estimation for translated
mRNA and total mRNA separately. Differences in of within-RNA variances
between RNA types can be expected due to varying experimental protocols
(Liang et al., 2018; Zhong et al., 2017). While the flexibility of GLMs
allows for complex study designs involving 2 or more treatment
conditions, Riborex and Ribodiff limit the study design to only two
conditions. DeltaTE gives their users full flexibility of the DESeq2 GLM
model. Xtail is a method developed for ribosome profiling that makes use
of DESeq2 for RNAseq count normalisation (Z. Xiao et al., 2016). Their
assessment of differences in translation efficiencies relies on
probability matrices for the ratio of translated mRNA over total mRNA
within condition and a between condition ratio of these ratios. Babel
was the first algorithm designed solely for analysis of differential
translation and uses an error-in-variables regression analysis (A. B.
Olshen et al., 2013). The error-in-variables regression allows
accounting for variable total mRNA levels when assessing changes in
translation. Although these methods have distinct approaches to identify
changes in translation efficiencies, their principle of analysis is
similar to comparing a ratio of ratios (see TE-score equation above).
Therefore these methods suffer from similar issues as the TE-score which
will be discussed in \emph{Study 1}.

\chapter{Aims of this thesis}

This thesis aims to expand current methodologies for analysis of
translation efficiency data and explore the regulation of gene
expression in cancer.

In \textbf{Study I}, we adapted the ANalysis Of Translation Activity
data (anota) algorithm so that it could be applied to next-generation
sequencing data. Furthermore, we implemented the analysis of
translational buffering a recently described mode for regulation of gene
expression. The resulting algorithm was named anota2seq.

We then applied the anota2seq algorithm to investigate changes in
translation efficiencies in two cancer models:

In \textbf{Study II} we unravelled the effects of eIF4A, an RNA
helicase, inhibition using a synthetic rocaglate CR-1-31-B (CR-31) in
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

In \textbf{Study III} we explored the effects of insulin on gene
expression in multiple cell lines.

\chapter{Results and discussion}

\section{Study 1 - Generally applicable transcriptome-wide analysis of translation using anota2seq}

Initially changes in translation efficiencies were estimated using the
TE-score approach as outlined in section \ref{algorithm}. However, this
method was being shown to be prone to spurious correlations leading to
elevated false positive identification that can result in false
biological conclusions (Larsson et al., 2010). Spurious correlations,
when using the TE-score, can be attributed the inadequate correction for
changes in total mRNA levels when estimating translation efficiencies
(Larsson et al., 2010, 2011). The Analysis of Translation Activity
(anota) algorithm facilitates analysis of translational efficiencies
that are corrected for changes in total mRNA levels (Larsson et al.,
2011).

Anota was developed for analysis of transcriptome-wide analysis for data
quantified by DNA- microarrays (Larsson et al., 2010). However, advances
in experimental methodologies lead to the development in RNA sequencing.
RNA sequencing and DNA microarray data have distinct characteristics
that need to be accounted for before analysis (\textbf{see section
\ref{algorithm}}). Therefore, while the statistical framework of anota
had been shown as an adequate approach for analysis of translational
efficiencies for data from DNA microarrays it was not directly
applicable to RNA sequencing data. The is due to the mean variance
relationship, a characteristic of RNA sequencing data. This encompasses
that the counts for lower expressed genes show higher variability than
counts for higher expressed genes even after log transformation. Efforts
have been made to make RNA sequencing data more ``DNA- microarray like''
so that algorithms developed for intensity based microarray data can be
applied to count based RNA sequencing data (Law et al., 2014; Love et
al., 2014). Anota2seq, the algorithm developed in this study, allows for
transformation and normalisation of RNA sequencing data so that the
anota statistical frame work can be applied for analysis of count data.

Another feature of anota2seq is that it allows for statistical analysis
of translational buffering. The need for the analysis of translational
buffering, or the uncoupling of mRNA levels from translation, has been
noted before anota2seq's development by comparing 20 translatomes and
transcriptomes with different underlying stimuli in mammalian cells
(Tebaldi et al., 2012). The same authors proposed a framework, called
tRanslatome, that combines several methodologies for analysis of
differential transcription and translation efficiencies, including
anota, for a comprehensive analysis of transcription and translation as
well as their underlying mechanisms (Tebaldi et al., 2014).

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{0.5\textwidth}
  \includegraphics{./figures/geneModes_anota2seq.pdf}
  \caption{anota2seq gene model for analysis of translational buffering /offsetting - Total mRNA expression is set out against translated mRNA expression for each biological replicate and treatment condition. The model shows total mRNA changes that are independent of translated mRNA changes which is classified as translational buffering. It is important to distinguish between the gene modes as their regulation could be due to different underlying biological mechanisms (see section \ref{modes}).
  \label{fig:anota2seq}}
\end{wrapfigure}

Nevertheless, commonly observed in polysome and ribosome profiling data
sets are three gene expression modes, translation, translational
buffering and mRNA abundance. While anota can be used to identify genes
among the translation and mRNA abundance mode, analysis for
translational buffering was not implemented therein (\emph{See Figure
\ref{fig:anota}}). Therefore, one would need to rely on the integration
of several methods to efficiently analyse transcriptome-wide studies of
translation efficiences. Anota2seq addresses this issue by changing the
analysis model as described in section \ref{algorithm} to analyse
changes in total mRNA levels corrected for changes in translated mRNA
levels (i.e.~translational buffering, \textbf{see figure
\ref{fig:anota2seq}}).

Application of anota2seq has successfully identified translational
buffering to which biological mechanisms could be linked, e.g.~as
mentioned earlier translationally bufferring under ER\(\alpha\)
depletion in prostate cancer (\textbf{see section \ref{modeBuffering}})
(Lorent et al., 2019). Furthermore, in \textbf{study 2} translational
buffering can be observed as a compensating mechanisms in ``healthy''
cells upon treatment with an eIF4A inhibitor and in \textbf{study 3} we
identify mTOR dependent translational buffering for mRNAs with certain
3' UTR characteristics.

The aim of this study was to compare anota2seq's performance to other
established algorithms (i.e.~DESeq2, RiboDiff, babel, TE-score and
Xtail) for analysis of translation efficiencies, specifically their
ability to distinguish the three prominent modes of gene expression. To
achieve this we used simulated data. While it is arguable to what extent
conclusion drawn from simulated data can be extended towards empirical
data it allows for a controlled environment where true positive changes
are known in advance. Furthermore, the mean-variance relationship in the
simulated data is based on a real polysome profiling data set to
increase confidence that drawn conclusions are also applicable to
empirical data (Guan et al., 2017). Furthermore, during testing of our
simulation we used an additional data set to estimate parameters from to
generate data sets. Using these simulated data to compare the
performance of the above mentioned algorithms showed almost identical
results.

The simulated data consisted of four replicates for translated mRNA and
total mRNA with a ``control'' and a ``treatment'' condition.
Furthermore, the data sets contained a combination of the following gene
sets:

\emph{``Unchanged''}: For this simulation category we sampled reads from
the same NB distribution for both the control and treatment conditions
in both the translated and total mRNA. This category represents genes
that would be unaffected by e.g.~a stimulus of between cellular states.

\emph{``mRNA abundance''}: For this category the control condition for
both the translated mRNA and total mRNA were sampled from the same NB
distribution. The NB distribution for \textbf{both translated mRNA and
total mRNA} of the treatment condition was altered so that values would
be drawn corresponding to a fold change (negative or positive) ranging
between 1.5 to 3.0. The directionality of the fold changes (i.e.~up or
down regulation) was the same for translated mRNA and total mRNA.

\emph{``translation''}: For this category the control condition for both
the translated mRNA and total mRNA were samled from the same NB
distribution. The NB distribution for \textbf{translated mRNA only} of
the treatment condition was altered so that values would be drawn
corresponding to a fold change (negative or positive) ranging between
1.5 to 3.0.

\emph{``buffering''}: For this category the control condition for both
the translated mRNA and total mRNA were sampled from the same NB
distribution. The NB distribution for \textbf{total mRNA only} of the
treatment condition was altered so that values would be drawn
corresponding to a fold change (negative or positive) ranging between
1.5 to 3.0.

As a first step, we tested whether the methods could properly control
for type-1 errors (i.e.~false positive identification). For this we
simulated a data set with genes belonging only to the ``unchanged''
category. This revealed that babel, but to an even greater extent Xtail,
were unable to control their type-1 error as these methods assigned low
p-values and FDRs when no real changes were present. DESeq2 was
marginally affected by this also. This indicated a limited applicability
of Xtail and babel for statistical analysis of translatomes.

From the comparative analysis of the analysis for changes in translation
efficiencies affecting protein levels we concluded that anota2seq
outperforms all other methods. This was assessed by comparing the area
under the curve from Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and
precision recall curves. The ROC curves showed a, albeit slightly,
better performance for detecting changes in translation. However, the
precision recall was much higher for anota2seq which can be accredited
to that the analysis principle of the other methods is based on
identifying changes regardless of whether the change is in the
translated mRNA or total mRNA (\emph{as explained in section
\ref{algorithm}}). Nevertheless, when comparing the performance using
simulated data in the absence of genes belonging to the ``buffering''
category anota2seq still showed superior performance.

Next to the a prior knowledge of the introduced changes in the
simulation data, it also allowed us to modify parameters to investigate
the robustness of the methods to increased variance, overall sequencing
depth and differing sequencing depth between samples. Here, all methods
showed robustness against variance and sequencing depth differences
between samples as long as a minimum of 5 million counts per sample was
reached.

A shortcoming in the simulation study is that we did not assess the
effects of systematic batch effects. Batch effects can be introduced
e.g.~during experimental design and there are many methods that try to
correct for these (W. E. Johnson et al., 2007; Leek, 2014; Y. Zhang et
al., 2020). Other ways to correct for batch effects is their inclusion
in the analysis model, which can be supplied to the analysis model in
DESeq2, edgeR as well as anota2seq. Indeed analysis of a dataset with
prominent batch effects showed that batch effects can dampen the
efficiency of the anota2seq algorithm to identify changes but can be
effectively corrected for in the algorithm.

In this study we developed an analysis algorithm for efficient
transcriptome-wide analysis of translation efficiencies applicable to
DNA-microarrays and RNA seq. Furthermore, anota2seq has been
successfully applied to broaden the knowledge around mRNA translation in
various different contexts (Chan et al., 2019; Chaparro et al., 2020;
Hipolito et al., 2019; Lorent et al., 2019). Furthermore, more recently
anota2seq has been used to compare mRNA levels between cytoplasmic mRNA
and mRNA stored in P-bodes showcasing that anota2seq is generally
applicable beyond analysis of translation efficiencies (Bearss et al.,
2021). \newline
\section{Study 2 - eIF4A supports an oncogenic translation program in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma}

Pancreatic cancer is considered a lethal malignancy and has limited
treatment options. While other cancers (e.g.~ovary, breast and stomach)
showed a decline in mortality rates, no major overall reduction in
mortality was observed for pancreatic cancer in the period of 1970-2021
(Carioli et al., 2021).

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) accounts for over 90\% of
exocrine pancreatic cancer, whereas non ductal pancreatic cancers
e.g.~acinar cell carcinomas are uncommon (Feldmann et al., 2007; Jun et
al., 2016). It is estimated the 60-70\% of the PDACs arise in the head
of the pancreas (Luchini et al., 2016). So far treatment options are
mostly limited to surgical removal, which often is impossible due to the
anatomical location of the pancreas head. The survival rate for this
disease is less than 10\% (Rawla et al., 2019). A Dutch nationwide study
indicated that in cases were surgical removal was possible survival only
increased from 9.1\% to 16.5\% (Latenstein et al., 2020).

With the increasing understanding of tumor heterogeneity anti-cancer
therapy improved (Biankin et al., 2011). For example, in breast cancer
stratification by histological, molecular and gene expression features
identified several breast cancer subtypes for which different treatment
options exist, e.g. \(ER^+\) breast cancer subtypes respond to endocrine
therapy, whereas \(ER^-\) do not (Andre et al., 2006; Parker et al.,
2009). While breast cancer treatment strategies benefit from a rather
well established understanding of the molecular subtypes, in pancreatic
cancer transcriptomic based subtyping is still ongoing (P. Bailey et
al., 2016; Collisson et al., 2019, 2011; Moffitt et al., 2015; Puleo et
al., 2018). Therefore, insufficient understanding of molecular
mechanisms that underpin PDAC hinder development of more efficient
therapeutic approaches.

While intricacies of molecular subtypes are still being investigated,
research has shown that oncogenic mutations in KRAS as well as
inactivation of tumor suppressor TP53 are commonly shared among PDACs
(S. Jones et al., 2008). Furthermore, PDACs have been shown to be
dependent on increased protein synthesis mediated induced via KRAS
mutations (Chio et al., 2016). This indicates an important role of mRNA
translation in PDAC.

The aim of \emph{study 2} was to investigate the therapeutic effects of
targeting eIF4A in a murine three dimensional PDAC organoid cell culture
with mutations in the \(Kras^{LSL-G12D}\), \(Trp53^{LSL-R172H}\) and
Pdx1-cre alleles that has been shown to recapitulate PDAC tumor
progression (Boj et al., 2015). Pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1
(PDX1), is an important factor for pancreatic differentiation. PDX1
knock out mice failed to develop a pancreas (Hale et al., 2005). The
inhibition of eIF4A was carried out using a synthetic rocaglate, CR-31.
Rocaglates have been shown to inhibit eIF4A helicase function and
displayed anti-tumor activity (Cencic et al., 2009).

We first wanted to establish the therapeutic validity of targeting eIF4A
in PDAC. \emph{In vitro} experiments comparing treated PDAC organoids
(KP) to their normal (N) counter parts revealed heightened sensitivity
of KP organoids to CR-31 treatment relative to N organoids. OP-puromycin
incorporation showed reduced protein synthesis in KP organoids, whereas
N organoids were affected to a lesser extent. Furthermore, similar
effects were found \emph{in vivo} for PDAC tumours. Here CR-31 reduced
protein synthesis (assessed by SUnSET assay), tumor growth (assessed by
ultra sound imaging) and increased survival of mice. The effect on
protein synthesis was not due to inhibition of oncogenic signalling
pathways which was evaluated via western blot assessing the
phosphorylation of e.g.~AKT, mTOR and 4E-BP1. From these findings we
concluded that there is therapeutic validity in targeting eIF4A in PDAC.

Using polysome profiling, we then sought to decipher the mechanisms
explaining the increased sensitivity to CR-31 in KP organoids. First we
investigated the differences in gene expression between untreated KP
organoids and N organoids. Analysis of changes in translation
efficiencies using anota2seq revealed massive modulation at both total
mRNA levels and translation indicative of underlying differences in
e.g.~genomic stability and enhanced oncogenic signalling impinging on
protein synthesis reported in PDAC (Boj et al., 2015). Consistent with
the \emph{in vitro} OP-puromycin incorporation and \emph{in vivo} SUNsET
experiments, CR-31 strongly impacted global protein synthesis in KP
organoids, while only exerting a modest effect in N organoids.

We then compared the translatomes of untreated KP organoids to that of N
organoids. This revealed differences at both total mRNA levels as well
as translation. Treatment of KP organoids with CR-31 reversed these
changes. Thus the translational program of KP organoids is reversed when
treated with CR-31. mRNAs affected by CR-31 in KP organoids showed
modulated total mRNA levels in N organoids, that were offset at the
level of translation. Translational offsetting maintain protein
homeostasis (Lorent et al., 2019). The ability for N organoids to
modulate mRNAs levels affected by CR-31, whereas KP cannot, could
partially explain as to why protein synthesis is not reduced to a
similar extent in N as in KP.

We then assessed 5' UTR characteristics of the mRNAs whose translation
was affected upon CR-31 treatment in KP organoids. It was reported that
eIF4A-senstive mRNAs showed overall and more structured 5' UTRs
(e.g.~containing G-quadruplexes) (Gandin et al., 2016; Rubio et al.,
2014; Wolfe et al., 2014). Furthermore, a mechanisms by which rocaglates
would clamp eIF4A to mRNAs with {[}A,G{]} repeats in their 5 UTR was
described (Iwasaki et al., 2016). However, mRNAs sensitive to CR-31
treatment herein had short 5' UTRs that were more structured when
corrected for their length without enrichment for 4G-quadruplexes or
{[}A,G{]} repeats. Therefore, CR-31 sensitive mRNAs in KP organoids show
5' UTR characteristics different from those reported in the literature
(\emph{see section \ref{sel4F}}). However, based on our polysome
profiling and 5' UTR analysis we concluded that eIF4A supports an
oncogenic translation program in PDAC cells for mRNAs with shorter but
structured 5' UTRs.

Translation of mRNAs harbouring shorter 5' UTRs has been shown to be
sensitive to eIF4E expression and encode for metabolic functions (Gandin
et al., 2016). When we compared an eIF4E overexpression signature in the
KP vs N and CR-31 treated KP we observed that in KP organoids
translationally regulated mRNAs under eIF4E overexpression were also
translationally activated. This observation is consistent with reports
of 4E-BP1 loss in pancreatic cancer and consequently increased ability
of eIF4E to engage in the eIF4F complex (Y. Martineau et al., 2014).
eIF4A inhibition in tumors resistant to mTOR inhibiton by loss of 4E-BP1
has been shown to circumvent this resistance (D. M√ºller et al., 2019).
Indeed, CR-31 treatment in KP organoids reversed the translational
profile for eIF4E sensitive mRNAs.

We further inspected the regulated gene sets in treated and untreated KP
organoids compared to N organoids. Here we could see an enrichment in
metabolic pathways, e.g.~Oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway was
upregulated at the polysome associated mRNA levels in untreated KP
compared to N, whereas in KP organoids CR-31 treatment reversed the
translational profile of this pathway. Furthermore, CR-31 treatment in
KP organoids lead to reduced oxygen consumption rates, whereas N
organoids where affected to a lesser extent. While measuring oxygen
consumption rates do not rule out that non-mitochondrial sources are
affected we attributed the observed decrease in oxygen consumption to
defective oxydative phosphorylation.

A way to counter loss of energy production through oxidative
phosphorylation is to increase activity of other metabolic pathways,
i.e.~glycolysis. However, in CR-31 treated KP porganoids we could not
detect an upregulation of glycolysis measured by \(U-C^{13}\) glucose
labeling and extra cellular acidification rates nor did CR-31 treatment
affect expression of glycolytic enzymes (e.g.~HK1,HK2, LDHA, SLCA1,
SLCA3). Furthermore, glucose deprivation did not further sensitise to
CR-31 treatment. However, the polysome profiling data revealed
translational downregulation and subsequent reduction of protein
expression for the glucose transporter Slc2a6. Indeed, perturbation of
Slc2a6 using \(sgRNA^{Slc2a6}\) in N and KP organoids revealed a
decrease in glucose uptake. From this we concluded that glycolytic
compensation of KP is diminished by translational regulation of the
glucose transporter Slc2a6 upon CR-31 treatment.

Among the translationally activated genes in the CR-31 treated KP
organoids where mRNAs involved in the glutamine metabolism (i.e.~Slc1a5
and Gls1). Furthermore, glutamine levels were elevated in patient
derived PDAC cell lines treated with CR-31. Glutamine can be converted
into \(\alpha\)-ketoglutarate and funneled into the citric acid cycle
and therefore can serve to increase energy production (D. Xiao et al.,
2016). Indeed, using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to
quantify metabolites after culturing PDAC cells in \(C_5^{13}\)-
glutamine, we identified a shift towards reductive carboxylation of
\(\alpha\)-ketoglutarate obtained from \(C_5^{13}\)- glutamine to
produce citrate. Notably, the reductive glutamine metabolism was not
elevated in N organoids.

A combined treatment of CR-31 with glutaminase inhibitors (BPTES or
CB839) could sensitise to CR-31 treatment patient-derived PDAC cells to
CR-31 treatment indicating that glutamine utlisation is important
therein. Therefore, our study suggests an eIF4A dependent translational
program in PDAC that can act as a theurapeutic target in PDAC.
Furthermore, a recently published ribosome profiling study of a CR-31
treated human pancreatic cancer cell line (PANC1) observed the same
therapeutic effect of CR-31 treatment \emph{in vivo} on survival and
tumor volume (Singh et al., 2021). This underlines the significance of
our study in identifying eIF4A as therapeutic target in PDAC.

Nevertheless, the same study indicated differences on the underlying
regulated mRNA subsets (Singh et al., 2021). They report, in line with
the literature, that eIF4A dependent mRNAs show long and structured 5'
UTRs containing \(GGC_4\) sequence motifs they propose to form
G-quadruplexes (Singh et al., 2021). This raises some questions about
the differences between experimental setups and their potential
influence on biological outcomes and interpretation thereof. For
instance, Singh et. al. performed ribosome profiling on a PANC1 cell
line culture treated with 25nM CR-31, wheres herein we performed
polysome profiling on a 3D-organoid culture treated with 10nM CR-31. The
differences between ribosome and polysome profiling have been discussed
extensively (see section \ref{exptMethod}). Furthermore, by measuring
IC50 concentrations for CR-31 in a panel of pancreatic cancer cell
lines, Singh et. al. show a \textasciitilde{}6-fold difference in
susceptability to CR-31 between the cell lines of which PANC1 cells were
most sensitive to CR-31. Dosage dependent viability experiments of
patient derived PDAC cells in our study revealed that at 10nM CR-31
treatment cell viability was reduced by \textasciitilde{}30\%, whereas
treatment with 25nM reduced viability by \textgreater{} 50\%.
Furthermore, in patient derived PDAC at 25nm CR-31 a combination
treatment of CR-31 and CB839 did not alter cell viability compared to
CR-31 treatment alone. However, at 12.50nM CR-31 treatment, combined
treated with CR-31 and CB839 further reduced viability. Therefore,
combining the findings of these two studies indicate that CR-31
treatment in PDAC indeed has a therapeutic effect. However the
underlying mechanisms that are observed in the transcriptome wide
analysis of translation efficiencies could be dependent on the
experimental method to assess mRNA translation, the model system and
drug concentrations. \newline
\section{Study 3 - Insulin signalling gene expression landscapes distinguish non-transformed vs. BCa cells}

Breast cancer is an umbrella term for a heterogeneous disease with
numerous molecular subtypes with different clinical behaviour.
Currently, breast cancer is classified into five major groups; luminal
A, luminal B, HER-2 enriched, triple negative/basal-like and normal-like
(Dai et al., 2015). The classification is based on histology and
molecular features. Histopathological features are determined by the
degree of tumor differentiation (tubule formation), nuclear pleomorphism
and proliferation (mitotic count). These charactersitics are then scored
into a histological grade (I-III) (Eliyatkƒ±n et al., 2015). As mentioned
earlier, receptor status of the progesterone (PR), estrogen (ER) and
HER-2 are evaluated and have implications for neo adjuvant and adjuvant
treatment strategies. Advances in technologies lead to classification of
breast cancer subtypes using gene expression profiles,e.g.~the PAM50
classification, that allow for unbiased classification of breast cancer
(Parker et al., 2009). A study that correlated the gene expression
profiles of the PAM50 classification found a significanlty higher
mRNA:protein correlation for PAM50 genes, indicating a prognostic value
(Johansson et al., 2019). Nevertheless, the authors observed intermixed
luminal B and HER2 clustering based on protein expression (Johansson et
al., 2019). This is in line with the literature where HER2 subtypes
receive conflicting mRNA based classifications (Prat et al., 2014).
Thus, the understanding of breast cancer subtypes has increased
tremendously leading to improved and targeted treatment options, however
there is need for further research to understand the full breast cancer
spectrum on a molecular level.

Another important factor to consider in breast cancer treatment are life
style and other health related issues that could impact cancer
progression or response to treatment, e.g.~obesity. Studies in the 1970
observed unfavorable prognosis for breast cancer in obese women (Abe et
al., 1976). Obesity can pose an increased risk to develop metabolic
disorders such as metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes that can lead to
hyperinsulinemia, i.e.~elevated physiological insulin levels (Saltiel,
2001).

The role of insulin in the body is to regulate glucose and lipid
metabolism as well as protein synthesis. Protein synthesis and
metabolism are often dysregulated in cancer (Hanahan et al., 2011;
Saltiel, 2001). Insulin can bind to its receptors insulin receptor (IR)
A and IR-B that activate the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/ERK signalling
pathways. A role of insulin in cancer progression has initially been
observed in long term tissues cultures where it increased metabolism as
well as growth (Osborne et al., 1976). IGFs (i.e.~IGF1 and IGF2) carry
out similar roles as insulin and bind to insulin-like growth factors
receptor 1 and 2. Insulin and IGFs can bind to either IRs or IGFRs.
Furthermore, IRs and IGFRs have been shown to form homo- and
heterodimers, e.g.~IR-A/IGF1R dimers. Studies indicate that insulin and
IGF singalling is nearly identical (Boucher et al., 2010; Pollak, 2008).
Additionally, IGF1 plays a role in cancer progression and its levels are
elevated upon hyperinsulinemia (Bailyes et al., 1997; Christopoulos et
al., 2015; Gallagher et al., 2010; A. Molinaro et al., 2019).

The importance of both IGF1 and insulin signalling in cancer has been
well established now and led to development of therapeutic strategies by
e.g.~targeting both IGF1R and INSR or the PI3K signalling pathway
(Kuijjer et al., 2013; Mayer et al., 2017). Yet, to this day the full
mechsanisms of insulin/IGF action in cancer remain poorly understood.
This study aims to bridge this gap in knowledge by elucidating the
effects of insulin signalling on gene expression using a multi-omics
(including transcriptomics, translatomics and proteomics) approach to
capture multiple steps of the gene expression pathway simultaneously.
Furthermore, we asses insulin signalling in cancer cells as well as
non-transformed epithelial cells.

We first investigated the effects of insulin on gene expression in a
luminal A breast cancer cell line, i.e.~MCF7 cells. MCF7 cells harbour
the PI3KC mutatation and are senstive to insulin stimulation.
Polysome-profiling revealed a strong modulation of total mRNA levels and
translational response upon insulin stimulation. Among the
translationally activated mRNAs were mRNAs with short 5' UTRs that
harboured TOP motifs which is in accordance that insulin signalling
leads to activation of mTORC1 and phosphorylation of its downstream
targets. When visualising the mRNAs in the data where MCF7 cells were
stimulated with insulin in the presence of torin1, an mTOR active site
inhibitor, we observed that the changes in mRNA translation were almost
fully reversed. This led to the conclusion that the effects of insulin
on gene expression are to a great extent dependent on mTOR activity.

What was surprising to us was the observation that a subset of mRNAs
exhibited translational buffering upon insulin stimulation while mTOR is
inhibited. For these mRNAs, the total mRNA levels were increased,
whereas the polysome-association was unaltered between conditions
effectively. Thus their changes in total mRNA levels where offset at the
level of translation. Using HiRIEF LC/MS we suggest that translationally
offset mRNAs maintain constant protein expression across conditions (R.
M. M. Branca et al., 2014; Lorent et al., 2019). The ability of
translational offsetting to maintain protein homeostasis has been shown
by others before (Lorent et al., 2019). These findings indicate that
mTOR can act as a gatekeeper for transcriptional programs to fine tune
translation in response to extra cellular or intra cellular signals.

MCF7 cells are of epithelial origin and therefore not ``classical''
insulin sensitive such as adipose tissue or muscle cells. Their strong
response to insulin prompted us to investigate whether this could be due
to cellular plasticity in cancer. To assess this we chose to compare the
effects found in MCF7 to a non-malignant epithelial cell type, i.e.~HMEC
cells. We found that insulin alone was not sufficient to stimulate the
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in HMEC to a similar extent as in MCF7. However, a
combination treatment of insulin and IGF1 in HMEC cells elicited a
similar reponse as insulin treatment in MCF7 alone. We therefore opted
to compare the combined insulin + IGF1 treatment in HMEC to that of MCF7
assuming their signalling cascades are nearly identical as proposed in
the literature (Boucher et al., 2010; Pollak, 2008).

Polysome profiling of the insulin + IGF1 stimulated HMEC cells revealed
a strong translational response which was similar to MCF7 cells.
Translationally activated mRNAs in HMEC showed 5' UTR features similar
to those in MCF7 cells. Consequently, their translational activation was
dependent on mTOR signalling evident from their translational
suppression under conditions when mTOR was inhibited during insulin +
IGF stimulation. Furthermore, comparing the mRNA signatures of HMEC and
MCF7 in the opposite cell line we suggested that changes at the level of
translation were almost fully in accord across cell types.

In contrast to MCF7 cells, HMEC did not elicit a strong strong
modulation of total mRNA levels as shown by the small number of changes
in mRNA abundance. When comparing a recently described transcription
signature induced after IR translocation to the nucleus, we could see
that in both HMEC and MCF7 these mRNA show changes in total mRNA levels
but of differing magnitude (Hancock et al., 2019). A possible
explanation for the different response in total mRNA levels could be due
to differences in, e.g.~chromosome instability between the cell lines
that expose different parts of the DNA to trans acting factors. While
not assessed herein, a transcription factor analysis paired with
chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing could provide insight
into this (P. J. Park, 2009; Solomon et al., 1988). Assuming a
consequence of having a weaker modulation of total mRNA leves, HMEC
cells did not elicit translational offsetting upon insulin + IGF1
stimulation when mTOR was inhibited. Thus the effects of insulin and
IGF1 signalling on mRNA translation are foremost mTOR dependent, however
total mRNA responses differ between malignant and non-malignant
epithelial cells.

The translational offsetting in MCF7 drove us to investigate this
phenomenon more. To assess differences dependent on mRNA characteristics
we defined two subsets. The ``reversed'' and the ``uncoupled'' (that is
translationally buffered when mTOR is inhibited) subsets that only
differed in their total mRNA response when mTOR was inhibited during
insulin stimulation. To rule out that the observed effects on total mRNA
are technical artifacts we validated total mRNA levels for two genes
from each subset. The differences in regulation of gene expression were
not dependent on codon usage which has been described before in a
different context (Lorent et al., 2019). However, overall uncoupled
mRNAs had shorter 3' UTRs with a higher GC content and were depleted for
HuR binding sites.

The depletion of HuR binding sites in the 3' UTRs of the uncoupled
subset prompted us to investigate mRNA stability differences. Using a
time series experiment under actinomycin D treatment to block
transcription quantified using nanoString, we found significant longer
mRNA half lifes for the uncoupled subset as compared to the reversed
subset. From these data we hypothesised that there are different
underlying mechanisms that regulate gene expression under conditions
where mRNA translation is dampened between these subsets. Under this
hypothesis the reversed subset is likely regulated through mRNA
stability, whereas the more stable uncoupled subset requires to be
regulated by translation as their total mRNA level remains high for
longer periods of time.

The involvement of HuR in this cannot be fully supported with our
current data as the analysis only supports a correlation between the
occurrence of HuR binding sites and the 3' UTRs of the reversed subset.
The effect on stability could be due to other trans acting factors,
e.g.~miRNAs and other RBPs (Valinezhad Orang et al., 2014). A way to
increase confidence is to investigate HuRs involvement experimentally,
e.g.~we could use a single guide (sgRNA) to silence HuR and measure
total mRNA levels of the reversed and uncoupled mRNAs previously
validated by qPCR. If HuR is involved, we would expect that the reversed
mRNAs retain higher total mRNA levels under the condition where mTOR is
inhibited during insulin stimulation in MCF7 cells as compared to
control. Furthermore, while the differences in total mRNA levels between
the insulin and the insulin and torin1 treated conditions in the RNAseq
data imply a treatment effect on the mRNA stability we did not observe
this in the time chase experiment quantified by nanoString. This raises
the question whether the transcription block induced by actinomycin D
could influence the regulation of mRNA stability between treatments. We
could address this by including actinomycin D in the sgHuR experiment
and see if effects thereof differ or setup an experiment independent of
sgHuR. Presence of an effect of actinomycin D on mRNA stability could
indicate a cross talk between transcription and regulation of mRNA
stability.

Since the translational offsetting identified herein was only observed
in insulin treated cancer cells, we wondered whether this is only
specific to this system. Cellular plasticity in cancer allows cancer
cells to obtain stem cell like features (Jewer et al., 2020; Quail et
al., 2012; Wahl et al., 2017). Therefore, we reasoned that a system were
we study gene expression of stem cells could give some insight whether
cancer cells obtained stem cell features that normal epithelial cells do
not have. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate whether other means of
mTOR inactivation, e.g.~hypoxia, would lead to similar effects on gene
expression. To assess these aspects we cultured H9 stem cells in medium
with insulin present in normoxia and hypoxia. This experimental setup
differs to that of MCF7 and HMEC cells as these were serum starved
(i.e.~no insulin in medium) prior to induction with insulin.

Studying this system in H9 we could observe changes for all three modes
for regulation of gene expression. Most notably, we observed a large
fraction of translationally buffered mRNAs with similar 3' UTR
characteristics to that of the uncoupled subset in MCF7 cells. Using
publicly available data on mRNA stability we saw that the
translationally buffered mRNA were overall more stable as compared to
their background. Furthermore, visualising the reversed and uncoupled
subset identified in MCF7 in the H9 data we observe differences in their
regulation of total mRNA levels, indicating that these subset underlie
different modes of regulation even across these two models. Furthermore,
these data argue for that translational buffering observed in insulin
treated MCF7 cells during mTOR inhibition is not limited to that system
but can also occur under more physiological conditions.

Here we present an unprecedented and comprehensive investigation of the
effects on insulin on gene expression in cancer cells and non-
transformed epithelial cells across multiple steps of the gene
expression pathway. Our results indicate that cancer cells have acquired
an increased sensitivity to insulin signalling as compared to
non-transformed epithelial cells that is largely dependent on mTOR in
both cell types. Furthermore, we observed that cancer cells have the
ability to translationally buffer mRNAs which is a feature they share
with stem cells.

\chapter{Conclusions}

Cancer is a vastly heterogeneous disease that is characterised by
uncontrollable growth and proliferation as well as dysregulated
metabolism that can evade therapy through acquiring resistance. mRNA
translation is a common denominator of these processes and it is
therefore paramount to understand the precise mechanisms by which mRNA
translation is regulated to better formulate therapeutic strategies
against cancer.

This thesis provides an advance in methodology to analyse
transcriptome-wide changes translation efficiencies that can be applied
to study cancer models. Using this methodology in the context of
pancreatic cancer we could propose a possible new therapeutic strategy
for this lethal disease where treatment options are limited. Lastly, we
explore the effects of insulin on gene expression in an unprecedented
study that highlighted an adapted insulin responsiveness of cancer
cells. Furthermore, we illuminate the ability of cancer cells to
translationally buffer genes which is a feature they share with stem
cells and could therefore be an acquired mechanism.

Taken together this thesis provides insight on gene expression in two
different cancer models that could potentially lead to clinical
applications. While these studies are a step forward, more research is
needed to grasp the full extent of the mechanisms involved in cancer.
