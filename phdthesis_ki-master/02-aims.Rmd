\chapter{Aims of this thesis}

The aims of this thesis are to explore the regulation of gene expression in cancer, more specifically we investigate perturbations of gene expression in different cancer models as a response to drug treatment.

In **Study I** we adapted an algorithm for ANalysis Of Translation Activity data (anota) so that it could be applied to next generation sequencing data. The resulting algorithm was named anota2seq.

We then applied the anota2seq algortihm to invesitigate changes in translation efficiencies in two cancer models:

In **Study II** we unravelled the effects of eIF4A, an RNA helicase, inhibition using a synthetic rocaglate CR-1-31-B (CR-31) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

In **Study III** we explored the effects of insulin on gene expression in a breast cancer cell line.
