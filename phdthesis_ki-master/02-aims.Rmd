\chapter{Aims of this thesis}


The aims of this thesis are to expand current methodologies for analysis of translation efficiency data and explore the regulation of gene expression in cancer.

In **Study I** we adapted an algorithm for ANalysis Of Translation Activity data (anota) so that it could be applied to next generation sequencing data. Furthermore, we implemented the analysis of translational buffering a recently described regulatory mode of gene expression. The resulting algorithm was named anota2seq.

We then applied the anota2seq algortihm to invesitigate changes in translation efficiencies in two cancer models:

In **Study II** we unravelled the effects of eIF4A, an RNA helicase, inhibition using a synthetic rocaglate CR-1-31-B (CR-31) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

In **Study III** we explored the effects of insulin on gene expression in a breast cancer cell line.
