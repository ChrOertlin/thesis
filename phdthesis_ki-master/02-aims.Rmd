\chapter{Aims of this thesis}
The aims of this thesis are to expand current methodologies for analysis of translation efficiency data and explore the regulation of gene expression in cancer.

In **Study I** we adapted the ANalysis Of Translation Activity data (anota) algorithm so that it could be applied to next generation sequencing data. Furthermore, we implemented the analysis of translational buffering a recently described regulatory mode of gene expression. The resulting algorithm was named anota2seq.

We then applied the anota2seq algorithm to investigate changes in translation efficiencies in two cancer models:

In **Study II** we unraveled the effects of eIF4A, an RNA helicase, inhibition using a synthetic rocaglate CR-1-31-B (CR-31) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

In **Study III** we explored the effects of insulin on gene expression in multiple cell lines.
