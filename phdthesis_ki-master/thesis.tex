\chapter{Introduction}\section{Gene expression}\subsection{The central dogma of gene expression}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{.6\textwidth}
  \includegraphics{./figures/geneExprPath_2.pdf}
  \caption{The gene expression pathway - DNA is transcribed into RNA containing a 5' cap (black oval) introns (teal boxes),exons (purple boxes) and a poly(A) tail. RNAs are processed into mRNAs that consisting of a 5' cap, exons and a poly(A) tail. mRNAs can be transported out of the cellular nucleus into the cytoplasm where they can be degraded, stored or translated into proteins depending on cellular demands. Synthesised proteins can be degraded by proteosomes. \label{fig:geneExprPath}}
\end{wrapfigure}

The whole genetic code of an organisms is stored as deoxyribonucleic
acid (DNA) molecules in a double stranded formation as highly condensed
chromosomes. Transcription is the process whereby temporary copies of
the DNA are generated, called transcripts or ribonucleic acid (RNA), and
occurs in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells. RNAs undergo processing by
which multiple different variants coming from the same region are
produced. A subset of protein-encoding processed RNAs is the so called
messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNAs are transported from the nucleus into the
cytoplasm where they can be stored, degraded or tranaslated into
proteins. Proteins themselves can also be degraded. (\textbf{see figure
\ref{fig:geneExprPath}}). This flow of genetic information into
expressed proteins is commonly referred to as the central dogma in
molecular biology (F. Crick, 1970). \clearpage
\subsection{Contribution to gene expression} Proteins are the last
product of the gene expression pathway and carry out the vast majority
of all cellular functions. While it is apparent that modulation of
protein levels will offer information on the changes in gene expression,
it cannot completely answer the question as to why the levels change. In
a disease context, protein levels alone might offer sufficient insight
to explain phenotypic differences. However, information on how these
differences arise mechanistically is obscured. Yet, these differences in
underlying biological mechanisms can be used as targets in therapeutic
strategies.

Recently developed developed system biology methods allow investigation
of gene expression at multiple levels on a genome-wide scale. Initially,
transcriptomics studies were applied to study gene expression with the
assumption that mRNA expression is the main determinant for protein
levels and therefore could be used as a proxy for them. However, this
view was challenged by several landmark studies that observed a poor
mRNA to protein correlation and indicated a larger role of
post-transcriptional regulation in gene expression than previously
assumed (de Sousa Abreu, Penalva, Marcotte, \& Vogel, 2009; J. Lu,
Tomfohr, \& Kepler, 2005; Schwanh√§usser et al., 2011; G. M. Silva \&
Vogel, 2016; Vogel \& Marcotte, 2012).

The debate regarding which step of the gene expression pathway
contributes most to the composition of the proteome is ongoing,
nevertheless an understanding has been reached that the context is a
major determinant. At steady state, mRNA levels seem to explain protein
abundance best, however in perturbed systems the contribution of
transcript abundance appears to have less impact relative to
post-transcriptional steps in regulation of gene expression (Y. Liu,
Beyer, \& Aebersold, 2016). For example in a study that stimuleted bone
marrow-derived dendritic cells with LPS, protein levels were dependent
on cellular transcript levels (Jovanovic et al., 2015). In contrast a
study investigating cells under endoplasmatic reticulum stress observed
extensive modulation at the protein levels, whereas mRNA transcript
abundance was only mildly affected (Cheng et al., 2016).

While the contribution of different steps of the gene expression is
dependent on many different factors, e.g.~cellular state or treatments,
mRNA translation (synthesis of proteins) is an essential process in
determining composition of the proteome. Furthermore, dysregulation of
mRNA translation has been observed in multiple diseases, ranging from
neurological disorders to cancer which warrants for a comprehensive
understanding of this process (Graff et al., 2009; Kapur \& Ackerman,
2018; L. J. Lee et al., 2021; Ruggero, 2013). This thesis will focus on
the role of mRNA translation in the context of cancer. \newline
\section{mRNA translation} \subsection{Structure of an mRNA} After
transcription, RNA transcripts are processed into mRNAs. mRNAs contain a
protein coding region which is flanked by untranslated regions (5' and
3' UTRs). UTRs contain post-transcriptional regulatory elements that
effect may affecy localisation, stability and translation of the mRNA
({\textbf{???}}; Leppek, Das, \& Barna, 2018; Loya et al., 2008)
(\emph{see \ref{fig:UTRFeat} and sections
\ref{translation},\ref{regmRNA} for details}). The 5' has a
7-methyl-guanylate (m7G) cap that is important for translation
initiation, while the 3' end has a poly-A tail protecting the mRNA
against degradation (Grifo, Tahara, Morgan, Shatkin, \& Merrick, 1983;
Wilusz, Wormington, \& Peltz, 2001). Multiple different mRNAs (isoforms
or transcript variants) from the same genomic region exist. These
variants may arise due to alternave transcription start site or a
process called alternative splicing which alters the exon composition
(e.g.~coding region) of an mRNA. These variants can co-exist at the same
time and have distinct properties and can perform distinct functions
(Joly Anne-Laure et al., 2018). Furthermore, splicing resulting in
alternative UTRs can introduce differences in translation for mRNAs
encoding the same protein (S. N. Floor \& Doudna, 2016; Jewer et al.,
2020).

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{1\textwidth}

  \caption{ An mRNA consists of a coding sequence, 5' and 3' untranslated regions flanking the coding sequence, a 5' cap and a poly-A tail. Located within the 5' and 3' untranslated region are post-transcriptional regulatory elements that can influence gene expression. Furthermore, the codon composition of the coding sequence influences translation elongation rates (see section \ref{tRNA}). uORF; upstream open reading frame; IRES, internatl ribosome entry site; CPE, cytoplasmic polyadenylation site; AAUAAA, polyadenylation signal.

\subsection{Translation of an mRNA} \label{translation} For the vast
majority of protein coding mRNAs, eukaryotic mRNA translation occurs in
the cytoplasm, however a small subset of not nuclear-encoded mRNAs is
translated in the mitochondria (D'Souza \& Minczuk, 2018). mRNA
translation is a process that includes initiation, elongation,
termination and ribosome recycling and is an essential process for
protein homeostasis (\textbf{see Figure \ref{fig:doodlemRNASteps}}).

During the initiation phase of 5' cap dependent mRNA translation a
ribosome is recruited to the mRNA following by scanning toward the 3'
end for a start codon to begin synthesis of the polypeptide chain by
incorporating amino acids (A. G. Hinnebusch, 2014). Furthermore, 5' cap
independent translation initiation can also occur, e.g.~via the internal
ribosome entry site in the 5' UTRs (*see Fig \ref{fig:UTRFeat}). Amino
acids are transferred to the ribosome by specialised RNAs called
transfer RNAs (tRNA) that can recognise the genetic code in the mRNA.
The availability of tRNAs as well as their modification can influence
the rate of elongation. The order by which amino acids are incorporated
is dictated by the order of the codons of the open reading frame (ORF).
There are more possible codon combinations in comparison to amino acids.
This allows that amino acids are encoded by multiple codons, for example
lysine is encoded by AAA and AAG. Once the ribosome encounters a stop
codon, translation will terminate and the polypeptide chain will be
released. The ribosome then disassociates from the mRNA and can be
recycled to engage translation of the same or another mRNA. The
following sections describe these processes in more detail.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{1\textwidth}
  \includegraphics{./figures/doodleTranslation.pdf}
  \caption{mRNA translation initiation, elongation, termination and ribosome recycling steps - The ribosome binds to the mRNA and initiates scanning for a start codon. The elongation phase incorporates amino acids into a polypeptide chain (i.e. the protein product). Once the end of the coding sequence is detected, by recognition of stop codons, the ribosome terminates translation and releases the polypeptide chain. The ribosome can then be recycled to participate in the translation of another mRNA or reinitiate. \label{fig:doodlemRNASteps}}
\end{wrapfigure}

\clearpage

\subsection{Initiation} \label{initiation}

In eukaryotes 5' cap dependent mRNA translation consists of multiple
stages. First, a ternary complex (TC) consisting of GTP bound eukaryotic
initiation factor (eIF) 2 and methionine-initiator tRNA (met-tRNAi) is
formed. This is followed by formation of the 43S pre initiation complex
(PIC) consisting of a 40S ribosome subunit, eIF1, eIF1A, eIF3, eIF5 and
the TC (Asano, Clayton, Shalev, \& Hinnebusch, 2000). mRNAs then
undergoe ``activation'' by which the 5' cap proximal structure is
unwound by eIF4F with eIF4B in an adenosine-tri-phosphate (ATP)
dependent manner. eIF4F is the 5' cap binding complex consisting of;
eIF4E, 5' cap binding protein; eIF4A, an RNA helicase and; eIF4G, a
scaffold protein (Grifo et al., 1983). Poly a binding protein (PABP)
binds in the 3' UTR and causes circularisation of the mRNA to improve
its stability and aid in recruitment of translation initiation factors
(Ivanov et al., 2016). The 43S complex then binds to this unwound region
and starts scanning in the 5' to 3' direction. Recognition of the
translation initiation codon (AUG) induced the 48S initiation complex
formation. Here displacement of eIF1 occurs which allows eIF5 to
hydrolyse eIF2-bound GTP. The 60S subunit then joins the 48S initiation
complex which causes the release of eIF2-GDP and other initiation
factors (eIF1, eIF3, eIF4B, eIF4F and eIF5) and is mediated by eIF5B.
After subunit joining the ribosome starts the elongation process
(\textbf{Figure \ref{initiation}}) (Asano et al., 2000; Hinnebusch,
2006; Jackson, Hellen, \& Pestova, 2010).

\subsection{Elongation}

The 80S ribosome contains three sites important for decoding an mRNA:
the aminoacyl (A), peptidyl (P) and exit (E) sites. During elongation in
eukaryotes, aminoacytelated tRNAs are delivered to the A-site in a TC
with eukaryotic elongation factor 1A (eEF1A) and guanosine triphosphate
(GTP). If the tRNA is cognate to the condon in the A-site of the
ribosome, eEF1A is hydrolysed causing its release and accommodating the
tRNA in the A-site. This is followed by a peptidyl transferase reaction
forming the peptide bond by the transfer of the nascent polypeptide from
peptidyl tRNA in the P-site to the amino group of the A-site
aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA). Then a translocation steps occurs through
eEF2-GTP hydrolysis which translaocates deacelated tRNA into the E-site
and peptidyl tRNA to the P-site. The deacytelated tRNA is then released
from the ribosome (Dever \& Green, 2012). This process is repeated until
a stop codon (UAA, UGA or UAG) enters the A site of the ribosome .

\end{wrapfigure}

mRNA translation termination is facilitated by two eukaryotic release
factors (eRF), eRF1 and eRF3-GTP (E. Z. Alkalaeva, Pisarev, Frolova,
Kisselev, \& Pestova, 2006; I. Stansfield et al., 1995). The
eRF2:eRF3-GTP complex binds to the A-site of the ribosome upon
recognition of a stop codon. This causes an hydrolysis event resulting
in a conformational change and release of the polypeptide chain. eRF1
and the ATP binding cassette protein (ABCE1) together promote the
splitting of the 60S and 40S subunits after which they can be recycled
(Hellen, 2018; Pisarev et al., 2010).

\subsection{Translation efficiency}

Each ribosome synthesises a single protein during translation of an mRNA
assuming it is not prematurely terminated. It has been known since the
'60s that translation of an mRNA occurs via multiple bound ribosomes
(polysomes) simultaneaously (\textbf{see figure \ref{fig:polysomes}A-C})
(Staehelin, Brinton, Wettstein, \& Noll, 1963; Warner, Rich, \& Hall,
1962). Therefore the translation efficiency of an mRNA depends on the
number of ribosomes it is associated with. While all steps of
translation can affect the translation efficiency of an mRNA, it is
thought to most commonly be regulated at the initiation step (Dever \&
Green, 2012; Jackson et al., 2010; Richter \& Coller, 2015).

Experimental methods, e.g.~polysome profiling, are used to study
translation efficiencies. Furthermore, there are efforts to model
translation kinetics such as totally asymmetric simple exclusion process
(TASEP) to obtain a better understanding of ribosome movements along the
mRNA (MacDonald, Gibbs, \& Pipkin, 1968; Maniloff, 1969) (\textbf{See
figure \ref{fig:polysomes}D}). A model that assessed ribosome traffic
under steady state and high initiation rates indicates traffic is not
only dependent on the densities of ribosomes but also codon specific
elongation rates and their distribution along the mRNA (Szavits-Nossan
\& Evans, 2020). The next section will go further into detail how
initiation rates and elongation can be regulated. \newline
\section{Regulation of mRNA translation} \label{regmRNA}

mRNA translation is the most energy consuming process in the cell. In a
study using concanavalin A stimulated rat thymocytes, it was estimated
that translation accounts for \textasciitilde{}20\% of the cellular
energy consumption (Buttgereit \& Brand, 1995). The high energy
consumption of mRNA translation and its central role in the gene
expression pathway requires it to be tightly regulated, especially in
cancer where dysregulated metabolism is common (Hanahan \& Weinberg,
2011).

Regulation of translation can be exerted at a global level
(i.e.~regulation of a large set of mRNA simultaneously) by
e.g.~perturbations of major signalling pathways impinging on mRNA
translation. Furthermore, a strong feature of translational control is
that it can affect distinct mRNA populations selectively. This form of
translational regulation acts on characteristics of mRNAs, e.g.~through
cis elements in the UTRs, RNA binding proteins (RBP) (\textbf{see figure
\ref{fig:UTRFeat}}) or regulation of initiation factors (Leppek et al.,
2018). Below we will discuss multiple mechanisms that regulate mRNA
translation globally or selectively.

\subsection{mTOR} \label{mTOR}

mTOR is a conserved Ser/Thr kinase and is found in two structurally and
functionally distinct complexes, mTORC1 and mTORC2 (Pearce et al., 2007;
Saxton \& Sabatini, 2017). In a growth promoting environment mTOR
switches cell metabolism to increase protein synthesis, lipids and
nucleotides, while suppressing catabolic pathways, e.g.~autophagy.
mTORC2 promotes survival via signalling through protein kinase A (AKT),
anabolic metabolism, and cytoskeleton regulation (Sarbassov, Guertin,
Ali, \& Sabatini, 2005,Zoncu, Efeyan, \& Sabatini (2011)).

mTOR activity is modulated via hormone and growth factor signalling
(i.e.~insulin and insulin-like growth factor; IGF1). This signalling is
predominantly mediated through the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) /
AKT pathway. However, the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)
pathway

Both these pathways are involved in oncogenic signalling and under
investigation as therapeutic targets in cancer (Hilger, Scheulen, \&
Strumberg, 2002; J. Yang et al., 2019). In several cancers (e.g.~breast,
lung, prostate and colon) the gene encoding the p110\(\alpha\) subunit
of PI3K is frequently mutated or amplified (J. W. Lee et al., 2005; D.
A. Levine et al., 2005; Samuels et al., 2004).

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.6\textwidth}
  \includegraphics{./figures/mTORsignal.jpg}
  \caption{Schematic representation of mTOR signaling to the translational machinery. Philippe P. Roux, and Ivan Topisirovic Mol. Cell. Biol. 2018; doi:10.1128/MCB.00070-18. Reprinted with permission. Copyright ¬© 2018, American Society for Microbiology
 \label{fig:mtorsignal}}
\end{wrapfigure}

The E545K mutation leads to a reduced inhibition of p85 at the catalytic
p110\(\alpha\) subunit of PI3K (W. Jiang et al., 2018). In \textbf{study
3} we investigate oncogenic signalling via the PI3K pathway activated by
insulin and the role of mTOR in mediating the resulting effects on gene
expression in the MCF7 breast cancer cell line that harbours the E545K
mutation (Schneck et al., 2013). Furthermore, hyperactivity of PI3K/AKT
and Ras/MAPK signalling pathways have been reported in multiple cancers
and been linked anti- cancer therapy resistance (P√≥pulo, Lopes, \&
Soares, 2012; Salaroglio, Mungo, Gazzano, Kopecka, \& Riganti, 2019; Tan
\& Yu, 2013). mTOR, as a downstream actor of these pathways integrating
their signals, has therefore become a focus of anti cancer therapy by
either targeting mTORC1 or using dual inhibitors for PI3K and mTOR (Bhat
et al., 2015).

mTOR also fulfills a central role in metabolic signalling where it
integrates amino acid availability, glucose and cellular oxygen levels
to form an appropriate response. For example, increased amino acid
availability induces relocalisation of mTOR into proximity of Rag
GTPases leading to its activation (Sancak et al., 2008). Furthermore,
Glucose deprivation and oxygen availability regulate mTOR activity via
adenosine-mono-phosphate kinase (AMPK) signalling. AMPK is activated
when a shift in the cellular AMP to adenosine-tri-phophate (ATP) ratio
is sensed (Kimball, 2006; M. J. Sanders, Grondin, Hegarty, Snowden, \&
Carling, 2007). While hypoxia (i.e.~deprivation of oxygen) inhibits
protein synthesis in normal cells, in breast cancer, protein synthesis
was not inhibited during hypoxia which is attributed to uncontrolled
mTOR signalling (Connolly, Braunstein, Formenti, \& Schneider, 2006).

Given the central of mTOR governing proliferation, growth and
metabolism, which are often deregulated in cancer, it is vital to
comprehensively understand mTORC1 signalling herein (Hanahan \&
Weinberg, 2011).

\subsubsection{Global regulation of translation via mTOR}

mTOR regulates mRNA translation mainly by regulating availability of
eIF4E through phosphorylation of 4E binding proteins (4E-BPs)(A.-C.
Gingras et al., 1999). eIF4E is required for mRNA 5' cap binding and
formation of the eIF4F complex. Therefore, inhibition of mTOR leads to a
down regulation of cap dependent mRNA translation. Other downstream
targets of mTOR such as S6k has been shown to regulate components of the
translation machinery, e.g.~by activation of programmed cell death
protein 4(PDCD4). PDCD4 competes for binding to eIF4G with eIF4A
(Dorrello et al., 2006; A. G√∂ke et al., 2002).

\subsubsection{Selective or "mTOR sensitive" regulation of translation}

Selective or ``mTOR sensitive'' regulation of translation acts on
transcripts with a terminal oligo pyrimidine motif (TOP mRNAs). This TOP
motif consists of a C followed by a stretch of 4-15 pyrimidines directly
after the 5' cap. TOP mRNAs show near complete dissociation from
ribosomes under conditions when mTOR is inhibited and are enriched for
genes encoding for parts of the translation machinery (Meyuhas, 2000;
Thoreen et al., 2012; Yamashita et al., 2008). Recent works indicate the
importance of La ribonucleoprotein domain family member 1 (LARP1) in
regulation of TOP mRNAs with contradictory findings (B. D. Fonseca et
al., 2015; Hopkins et al., 2016; Jia et al., 2021; Maraia, Mattijssen,
Cruz-Gallardo, \& Conte, 2017). A panel of researches were asked to
evaluate these findings which led to the establishment of a model for
translational regulation via LARP1 (Berman et al., 2021). Herein, LARP1
is thought to bind to the 5' mRNA cap of TOP mRNAs via its DM15 domain
and represses translation by obstructing eIF4E binding in instances
where mTOR activity is abolished. In environments where mTOR is active
phosphorylation of the DM15 occurs by mTOR causing it to release the 5'
cap, wile the la domain of LARP1 remains bound to the mRNA thereby
stabilizing it to facilitate translation (Berman et al., 2021). Other
instances of selective translation are for mRNAs that lack the TOP
motif, but show sensitivity to mTOR activity due to its role in eIF4F
complex formation.

\subsection{selective regulation through members of the eIF4F complex}

As mentioned before, the eIF4F complex consists of eIF4E, eIF4A and
eIF4G and is required for translation of all cap dependent mRNAs.
However, characteristics of 5' UTRs introduce variation to how well
mRNAs can be translated. Graff et al. proposed a model of strong and
weak mRNAs. Herein, strong mRNAs are widely expressed and represent the
majority of cellular mRNAs and are characterised by short unstructured
5' UTRs, e.g. \(\beta\)-actin. On the other hand, weak mRNAs show long
and structured 5' UTRs and encode for potent growth and survival
factors, e.g.~c-Myc, ornithine decarboxylase (ODC1) and vascular
endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Translation of ``strong'' mRNAs would
remain effective in conditions where eIF4F complex availability would be
limited. However, ``weak'' mRNAs show sensitivity eIF4F availability
which is dependent on eIF4E expression (Graff, Konicek, Carter, \&
Marcusson, 2008). Elevated eIF4E expression is common in cancer and
drives malignancy (De Benedetti \& Graff, 2004).

Studies investigated the effects of eIF4A inhibition on mRNA translation
and the underlying characteristics of eIF4A dependent mRNAs. Therein,
mRNAs that were senstitive to silvesterol treatment showed
characteristics of ``weak'' mRNAs, i.e.~long and structured 5' UTRs
(Rubio et al., 2014; Waldron, Raza, \& Le Quesne, 2018; Wolfe et al.,
2014). In addition one third of eIF4A dependent mRNAs were encoded by
genes with multiple 5' UTR variants, while for eIF4A independent mRNAs
this was \textless{} 1\% (Rubio et al., 2014). Translation of mRNAs with
different 5' UTR variants has recently been implicated to drive cancer
cell plasticity towards more ``stem cell like'' phenotypes during
hypoxia (Jewer et al., 2020).

Recently, a more nuanced picture for translation of mRNAs sensitive to
inhibition of components of the eIF4F complex has been shown (Gandin et
al., 2016). Therein, a comparison of treatments with an mTOR inhibitor
(i.e.~limiting eIF4F complex assembly) and silvesterol were evaluated
leading to identification of mTOR-eIF4E and mTOR-eIF4A senstive mRNAs.
Indeed, as shown before mTOR-eIF4A senstive mRNAs were characterised by
long and structured 5' UTRs and endoced for pro surival proteins,
however their translation was also dependent on eIF4E availability.
mTOR-eIF4E sensitive mRNAs were characterised by short 5' UTRs and did
not show dependence on eIF4A. Furthermore, these mRNAs encode for
proteins related to metabolism.

\subsection{The integrated stress response}

The integrated stress response is a pathway which is activated through
kinases responding to various stress signals. These kinases include
Protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) which is
activated by misfolded peptides in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER),
Heme regulated eIF2alpha kinase (HRI) which is activated during
oxidative stress, protein kinase R (PKR) which is activated in response
to certain viral infections by binding to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
and general control nonderepressible 2 (GCN2) which is activated when
cells are deprived of amino acids(Dmitry E Andreev et al., 2015; Guan et
al., 2017; Kapur, Monaghan, \& Ackerman, 2017; Lemaire, Lary, \& Cole,
2005; Taniuchi, Miyake, Tsugawa, Oyadomari, \& Oyadomari, 2016). During
the integrated stress response the alpha subunit of eIF2 is
phosphorylated. Phosphorylated eIF2\(\alpha\) directly engages the
guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B and prevents conversion of
inactive eIF2-GDP to active eIF2-GTP needed for met-tRNAi incorporation
in the TC, therefore inhibiting translation by reducing TC availability
(Sonenberg \& Hinnebusch, 2009) (\textbf{see also figure
\ref{fig:initiation}}).

\subsubsection{Global and selective regulation of translation via the ISR}

Global and selective regulation of translation via the ISR is, similar
to mTOR signalling, achieved at a global and selective level.
Phosphorylation of eIF2 alpha limits ternary complex availability,
therefore met-tRNAi recruitment to the ribosome is limited which results
in a reduction of translation initiation. While global translation is
reduced upon ISR, translation of a selective subset of mRNA with
upstream open reading frames (uORFs) is increased. A uORF is a reading
frame that originates in the 5' UTR of an mRNA upstream of the coding
sequence ORF. uORFs can be out of frame with the main ORF (mORF) and,
when translated, lower the expression of the mORF (Kozak, 1984).
Activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), a transcription factor for
stress response genes, contains multiple uORFs of which one partially
overlaps with the mORF. Under normal conditions ATF4 mRNA translation is
initiated at uORF1 and reinitiation at uORF2 occurs. The overlap of
uORF2 with the mORF causes ribosomes to synthesise protein from uORF2
thereby inhibiting the translation of the coding sequence. Limitation of
TC availability during ISR causes longer ribosome scanning times leading
to that ribosomes scan past uORF2 and initiate at the mORF (i.e.~delayed
initiation) (Pakos-Zebrucka et al., 2016).

Ribosome profiling studies indicate that 50\% of mammalian mRNAs harbour
uORFs . mRNAs containing uORFs include oncogenes and transcripts
important in differentiation and cell cycle (Calvo, Pagliarini, \&
Mootha, 2009; Ingolia, Lareau, \& Weissman, 2011). Apart from delayed
initiation, uORF translation can also be due to ``leaky'' scanning or
reinitiation downstream of a uORF stop codon. The surrounding sequence
of the uORF is important for initiation of translation. An AUG in the
classical Kozak context (i.e.~RNN\textbf{AUG}G) is most efficient for
translation initiation due to better recognition by the met-tRNAi (Calvo
et al., 2009; Kozak, 1986).

However, uORFs that do not contain AUG have been described as well. For
example in Fli-1, two conserved uORFs have been described where one
contains an AUG and the other GUG (Sarrazin et al., 2000). Translation
of either uORF results in different proteins isoforms endoded in the
same mRNA. Furthermore, other elements (e.g.~structures) in proximity of
the uORF can also influence its translation (H. Ruan, Hill,
Fatemie-Nainie, \& Morris, 1994). \clearpage
\subsection{Regulation of mRNA translation by tRNAs} \label{tRNA}

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{0.6\textwidth}
  \includegraphics{./figures/tRNA.pdf}
  \caption{ (A) Schematic representation of the tRNA cloverleaf structure with indicated anti-codon and amino acid acceptor sites.  (B) Schematic representation of the proliferation and differentiation mRNAs dependent on distinct tRNA subsets. (C) Schematic representation of the U34 wobble position and the catalytic enzymes involved in this modification that is implied in tumor progression.
 \label{fig:tRNA}}
\end{wrapfigure}

As touched upon earlier, tRNAs are an essential part of the translation
machinery that carry the amino acids to the ribosome. tRNAs consist of a
76-90 long nucleotide sequence set into a ``cloverleaf'' structure
forming several loops (Sharp, Schaack, Cooley, Burke, \& Soil, 1985)
(\textbf{see figure \ref{tRNA}}). The acceptor stem binds the amino acid
carried by the tRNA, while the anti-codon loop binds to the mRNA within
the ribosome via classical watson-crick pairing (Watson \& Crick, 1953).
Multiple codons can encode for the same amino acid (synonymous codons),
however the availability of the tRNAs for different codons may vary
which can influence elongation rates.

This supply ( i.e.~tRNA availability) and demand (i.e.~codon in
expressed mRNA transcripts) relationship has been found to vary across
different cellular states, e.g.~proliferation and differentiation.
Gingold et. al. observed two differen tRNA subsets; one induced under
proliferation that is otherwise repressed and a subset with similar
regulation under differentiation of which the supply matches the codon
demand of the transcriptome (Gingold et al., 2014). This model has been
disputed and it was proposed that the observed differences would be
attributed to GC content in the mRNA (Rudolph et al., 2016).
Nevertheless, abbarent tRNA expression and codon usage have been
reported in cancer (Z. Zhang et al., 2018). Furthermore, a comprehensive
study including small RNAseq (i.e.~for identification of tRNAs) and
protein samples across 17 tissues obtained from the The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) reported a tRNA signature stratified by Ki67 (a
proliferation marker) staining with implications for patient survival
(Hernandez-Alias, Benisty, Schaefer, \& Serrano, 2020). Therefore, while
a consensus on proliferation specific tRNA subsets might not have been
reached, emerging evidence implicates a role thereof in cancer (Gingold
et al., 2014; Hernandez-Alias et al., 2020; Z. Zhang et al., 2018). More
specifically, increased expression of \(tRNA_{CCG}^{Arg}\) and
\(tRNA_{UUC}^{Glu}\) has been observed in breast cancer cell lines and
proposed to drive metastasis (Goodarzi et al., 2016).

Others report of a role of tRNAs in cancer attributed to tRNA
modifications, specifically at the U34 anti- codon (or wobble) position
which is highly conserved (El Yacoubi, Bailly, \& de Cr√©cy-Lagard, 2012;
Rapino, Delaunay, Zhou, Chariot, \& Close, 2017). Wobbling was proposed
by Francis Crick and refers to the ability of non-watson-crick base
pairing of tRNA anti codons (F. H. Crick, 1966). This enables a smaller
set of tRNAs (41-55 in eukaryotes) to encode for the 64 possible codon
combinations (Goodenbour \& Pan, 2006). In mammals, the U34 modification
catalytic cascade involves the acetyltransferase Elongator (ELP3), the
methyltransferase TRM9-like domain of Alkylation repair homolog 8
(ALKBH8), and the urmylation (URM) pathway, that includes the cytosolic
thiouridylase homolog 1 and 2 (CTU1/CTU2) (Kalhor \& Clarke, 2003;
Karlsborn et al., 2014). These enzymes ultimately modify the U34
modification into 5-methoxycarbonyl-methyl-2-thiouridine (\(mcm^5s^2U\))
which ensures cognate codon recognition. This modification is thought to
occur in a small subset of tRNAs, namely \(tRNA^{UUU}\), \(tRNA^{UUC}\),
\(tRNA^{UUG}\), \(tRNA^{UCC}\), and \(tRNA^{UCU}\).

Loss of the ability to modify U34 has been shown to reduce translation
elongation rates with varying effects on protein expression (Deng et
al., 2015; Nedialkova \& Leidel, 2015; Zinshteyn \& Gilbert, 2013).
While in some cases U34 dependent signalling led to ribosome stalling
resulting in protein aggregates and increased stress (Nedialkova \&
Leidel, 2015; Zinshteyn \& Gilbert, 2013), others reported a subtle
dowregulation of proteins encoded by mRNAs requiring U34-modified tRNAs
(Deng et al., 2015). U34 modification dependent tRNAs have been shown to
play a role in cancer. For example, ELP3 is important in tumor
initiation in the intestine and promotes breast cancer invasion as well
as progression to metastasis (Delaunay et al., 2016; Ladang et al.,
2015). Furthermore, loss of U34 modification in a prostate cancer model
lead to an adaptive transcriptional response for mRNAs whose translation
was dependent on the U34 modification (Lorent et al., 2019).

\subsection{RNA binding proteins and trans-acting factors}

The UTRs of an mRNA contain sequence elements to which small RNA and RNA
binding proteins (RBPs) bind and exert translational regulation. For
instance, microRNAs (miRNA), a small class of non coding RNA. The
precise role and mechanisms in regulation of translation of miRNAs is
still under active investigation (Oliveto, Mancino, Manfrini, \& Biffo,
2017). However, they can directly bind to other RNAs and silence them
accomplished through translational repression or destabilisation
{[}Jonas2015{]}. Regulation of gene expression by miRNAs has been
observed in cancer where miRNAs have been implicated to promote
tumorgenesis or act as tumor suppressors (Muniyappa et al., 2009; Nagpal
et al., 2015; Sampson et al., 2007; Tian et al., 2010).

RBPs are a class of proteins involved in many regulatory steps of gene
expression and account for \textasciitilde{}7.5\% of the protein coding
genes. The poly-A-binding-protein (PABP) is a RBP involved in mRNA
translation initiation. PABP is thought to form a closed loop complex of
the 3' end to the 5' by interacting with eIF4G. This closed loop is
proposed to promote translation and prevent mRNA decay (Afonina,
Myasnikov, Shirokov, Klaholz, \& Spirin, 2014; Amrani, Ghosh, Mangus, \&
Jacobson, 2008) (\textbf{see also figure \ref{fig:initiation}}). Another
important RBP implicated in regulation of translation is Human antigen R
(HuR). HuR preferentially binds to AU-rich sequences in the 3' UTR and
acts as a stabilizing agent and is involved in RNA-processing (Baou,
Norton, \& Murphy, 2011; X. C. Fan \& Steitz, 1998; T. D. Levine, Gao,
King, Andrews, \& Keene, 1993; S. S.-Y. Peng, Chen, Xu, \& Shyu, 1998).
Furthermore, a study in adenocarcinoma implicates that HuR inhibits
translation of proapoptotic factors (Winkler et al., 2014). Other
studies in breast, colon and lung cancer observed correlation between
HuR and malignancy. Among its targets are hypoxia inducible factor 1
(HIF-1), VEGF and c-Myc which are known drivers for tumor progression
(Denkert et al., 2004; L√≥pez de Silanes et al., 2003; L√≥pez de Silanes,
Lal, \& Gorospe, 2005). \clearpage
\section{Expertimental methods to measure mRNA translation} \label{exptMethod}

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.6\textwidth}
    \includegraphics{./figures/polyRibo.pdf}
  \caption{Polysome profiling and ribosome profiling workflows. In polysome profiling a fraction from whole cytoplasmic RNA is loaded onto a sucrose gradient on which they get separated by sedimentation using ultra centrifugation. Fractions corresponding to efficiently translated mRNAs are collected and can be quantified with for example RNA sequencing (left). During ribosome profiling a fraction from the whole cytoplasmic RNA is exposed to a digestion agent which disturbs the RNA. The ribosomes will protect fragments thereby creating ribosome protected fragments. These fragments are then isolated and can be sequenced.  \label{fig:polyRibo}}
\end{wrapfigure}

Methods that measure mRNA translation try to capture the number of
ribosomes an mRNA is associated with on the principle that this is
directly correlated with their translation efficiency. This is under the
assumption that elongation rates across pools of mRNAs are similar which
is supported by ribosome kinetic studies (Ingolia et al., 2011). Two
methods are predominantly used for measuring mRNA translation, or
changes in translation efficiencies across conditions, namely polysome
profiling and ribosome profiling (\textbf{see figure
\ref{fig:polyRibo}}). The methods will be explained below in further
detail.

\subsection{Polysome profiling}

Polysome profiling is a technique to measure changes in translational
efficiencies of mRNAs between two or more conditions. Polysome profiling
allows for separation of polysomes from monosomes, ribosomal subunits
and messenger ribonucleoprotein particles (mRNPs). During the assay,
ribosomes are immobilized on the mRNAs using translation elongation
inhibitors (e.g.~cycloheximide (CHX)). A portion of cytoplasmic RNA
extracts then sediment on a linear sucrose gradient (5-50\%) using ultra
centrifugation. The resulting gradient is fractionated and mRNAs with
different number of bound ribosomes can be extracted and analyzed for
changes in translational efficiency (Gandin et al., 2014). Typically
fractions belonging to mRNAs with more than 3 bound ribosomes are
pooled. A 3-ribosome cut off has been chosen as it is thought to capture
most biologically relevant changes in translation efficiency (Gandin et
al., 2016).

\begin{wrapfigure}{r}{0.6\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{./figures/polysome_shifts.pdf}
  \caption{Polysome profliles -  (top left) Schematic representation of a polysome profile using linear sucrose gradient fractionation. Indicated in the polysome profiles are the 40S, 60S ribosomal subunits as well as the 80S monosome. H.P. indicates heavy polysome fractions.Between conditions (i.e. black an pink lines) distribution changes for mRNA abundance (grey and green; top right), translation (grey and red; bottom left) and translation within high polysome fractions (grey and red; bottom right) are illustrated. \label{fig:polysome}}
\end{wrapfigure}

An illustration of a polysome profile with peaks for the 40S, 60S
subunits and 80S ribosome can be seen in (\textbf{Fig \ref{fig:polysome}
top left}). Subsequent peaks along the frations indicate the mRNAs with
2 or more bound ribosomes. mRNAs are typically normally distributed
along the fractions, i.e.~in a pool of the same mRNA many will be
associated with different numbers of ribosomes (Gandin et al., 2016).
Changes in mRNA abundance will lead to an overall increase in the amount
of isolated polysome-associated mRNA without a shift of the distribution
along the fractions (\textbf{Fig \ref{fig:polysome} top right}). This
means that the translation efficiency per mRNA remains unchanged.
Changes in translational efficiency can be observed by shifts of
polysome association for mRNAs from the light (inefficiently translated)
towards the heavy (efficiently translated) polysome fractions or vice
versa (\textbf{Fig \ref{fig:polysome} bottom left}). Shift within the
heavy polysome fractions (i.e.~with a mean distribution around 4 bound
ribosomes to 7 bound ribosomes) can also occur (\textbf{Fig
\ref{fig:polysome} bottom right}). Quantification of mRNA levels within
each fraction can be assessed using Northern blotting or reverse
transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). For
transcriptome wide studies quantification is done using either
DNA-microarrays or RNA sequencing.

Pooling of mRNAs as well as collection of multiple fractions makes
polysome profiling inconvenient when dealing with large samples sizes or
experiments with low amounts of input RNA. Therefore, an optimized
sucrose gradient was developed where mRNAs bound to \textgreater{}3
ribosomes are collected on a sucrose cushion and thereby can be isolated
from one single fraction (Liang et al., 2018). This optimized gradient
allows for application of polysome profiling in small tissue samples
where RNA quantity is limiting and reduces labor intensity of the assay.

Polysome-associated mRNA levels are subject to changes in translation
efficiency as well as factors contributing to cytosolic mRNA levels that
impact to pool of mRNAs that can associate with ribosomes
e.g.~transcription and mRNA stability. Therefore, to identify true
changes in translation efficiency it is important to collect cytoplasmic
mRNA and polysome-associated mRNA from the same sample in parallel to
correct for such mechanisms during downstream analysis.

\subsection{Ribosome profiling} \label{riboseq}

Ribosome profiling is a technique that enables sequencing of ribosome
protected mRNA fragments (RPFs) (J. A. Steitz, 1969). In the assay
ribosomes are immobilized on the mRNAs using, similar to polysome
profiling, translation elongations inhibitors (e.g.~CHX) (Ingolia, 2016;
Ingolia, Ghaemmaghami, Newman, \& Weissman, 2009). One limitation with
the use of translation elongation inhibitors is the distortion of
ribosome distributions especially at translation initiation sites
(Gerashchenko \& Gladyshev, 2014; Hussmann, Patchett, Johnson, Sawyer,
\& Press, 2015). For example, treatment with cyclohexamide can affect
identification of uORFs in ribosome profiling experiments (Spealman et
al., 2018). These introduced artefacts need to be accounted for in the
downstream analysis when assessing ribosome position along the mRNA.

RPFs are obtained by RNAse treatment that degrades the links of RNA
between ribosomes leaving single ribosomes with a \textasciitilde{}28
nucleotide long RNA fragment within each ribosome. However, as ribosomal
RNAs (rRNA) is also degraded during this process they represent a big
fraction herein. The RPFs are then isolated using ultra centrifugation
through a sucrose cushion. During this step other RNA fragments such as
rRNAs, non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) or large ribonucleoprotein complexes can
co-migrate and contaminate the sample. Typically RPFs with a size
ranging from 25-30 nucleotides are selected for quantification. However,
among these sizes could be RNA protected by RBPs that have no ribosome
associated to it. Furthermore, ribosomes undergoing conformational
changes have been shown to protect fragments corresponding to a length
of 21nt only when translation elongation is blocked by e.g.~CHX (L. F.
Lareau, Hite, Hogan, \& Brown, 2014). Therefore, size selection can
distort the estimation of translation efficiency from ribosome profiling
data (Dmitry E. Andreev et al., 2017). From the resulting RPFs libraries
can be constructed and quantified using RNA sequencing. During library
construction additional biases due to enzyme sequence preferences can be
introduced that can lead wrong estimations of codon positions within the
ribosome (Artieri \& Fraser, 2014a).

Initially, fragmented total mRNA using alkaline hydrolysis of the same
size were retrieved in paralell to RPFs. This was achieved by extraction
of total mRNA from cell lysate followed by purification via recovery of
polyadenylated messages or removal of ribosomal RNA (Brar \& Weissman,
2015; Ingolia et al., 2009). The random fragmentation of total mRNA has
been shown to underlie experimental bias. Therefore, now unfragmented
total mRNA is sequenced in parallel.

\subsection{Comparing ribosome and polysome profiling}

Albeit both methods generate count data after quantification with RNA
sequencing, there are some key aspects that differ between the
techniques. Polysome profiling separates efficiently translated mRNAs
from non- efficiently translated mRNAs along a sucrose gradient thereby
creating an mRNA based perspective for analysing changes in
translational efficiencies. In contrast, ribosome profiling determines
translational efficiencies by counting the number of RPFs of both
efficiently and non-efficiently translated mRNAs. This can have
implications for identifaction of transcript variants. For example If a
ribosome would not protect a fragment spanning a variant the information
would be lost during ribosome profiling (S. N. Floor \& Doudna, 2016).
Whereas in polysome profiling the quantification is based on the whole
mRNA. This gives polysome profiling the advantage in cases of transcript
variants with different 5' UTR lengths.

Changes in translational efficiencies, e.g.~shifts in ribosome
association, can be dramatic (i.e.~near complete dissociation of
ribosomes from an mRNA) or subtle (shifts from e.g.~2 to 4 ribosomes)
and could be due to different properties of the mRNAs (Gandin et al.,
2016). When these two changes in translation efficiencies are present in
parallel, ribosome profiling is biased towards identification of
dramatic shifts and masks the subtle ones, leading to false biological
conclusions (Gandin et al., 2016). This has been attrituted to the
indirect estimation of translation efficiencies from counting RPFs for
ribosome profiling, which is highly dependent on the abundance of mRNAs.
In polysome profiling this effect is much less pronounced as changes in
translation efficiency are directly estimated from the mRNAs associated
with heavy polysomes (Masvidal, Hulea, Furic, Topisirovic, \& Larsson,
2017). Higher sensitivity in detecting changes in translational
efficiencies on a global scale makes polysome profiling more suitable
for transcriptome-wide studies (Gandin et al., 2016; Masvidal et al.,
2017).

An advantage of ribosome profiling is that it provides exact nucleotide
positions occupied by ribosomes. This offers information at a single
nucleotide level where the ribosome sits. Polysome profiling cannot
reveal ribosome locations along the mRNA. The single nucleotide
resolution of ribosome profiling is necessary in contexts studying local
translation events such as ribosomal frame shifts (Rato, Amirova, Bates,
Stansfield, \& Wallace, 2011) or uORF translation (Dmitry E Andreev et
al., 2015).

Both methods have their strengths and weaknesses and therefore each
method should be considered depending on the underlying biological
question. \newline
\section{Modes for regulation of gene expression through mRNA translation} \label{modes}

From transcriptome-wide assessments of translation using ribosome or
polysome profiling expression levels are obtained for both cytoplasmic
and polysome-associated mRNAs (or RPFs). For simplicity, from now on,
these RNA types will be referred to as total mRNA (i.e.~cytoplasmic
mRNA) and translated mRNA (i.e.~polysome-associated mRNA or RPFs). The
estimation of expression levels for both translated mRNA and total mRNA
allows for interrogation at two steps of the gene expression pathway and
their interaction. The interplay of total mRNA with translated mRNA can
give valuable insights about the underlying mechanisms that govern gene
expression in the studied system.

\begin{wrapfigure}{l}{0.6\textwidth}
  \includegraphics{./figures/geneModes_MRNA.pdf}
  \caption{Regulatory modes of gene expression - Schematic representation of regulatory modes of translation efficiency in a fold-change scatter plot. Indicated in red are changes in translation (i.e. changes in translated mRNA but not total mRNA), in green changes in mRNA abundance (i.e. congruent changes between total mRNA and translated mRNA) and in blue translational buffering (i.e. changes in total mRNA levels but not translated mRNA levels). TE changes as the TE-score would estimate them are indicated.\label{fig:modes}}
\end{wrapfigure}

When comparing perturbed systems to their corresponding control state we
typically observe three ``modes'' in which translated mRNA and total
mRNA distinctly interact that impact gene expression (\textbf{See figure
\ref{modes}}). We refer to these modes as ``translation'', ``mRNA
abundance'' and ``translational buffering''.

\subsection{Translation}

A change in translation occurs when translated mRNA levels either
increase or decrease, however corresponding total mRNA levels remain
constant or change to a lesser extent resulting in a change of their
translation efficiency. A prominent example of this mode can be observed
for TOP mRNAs. These mRNAs, under conditions when mTOR is inhibited,
show a near complete dissassociation from ribosomes (Gandin et al.,
2016). mRNAs under the translation mode are expected to reshape the
proteome (\textbf{See figure \ref{modes}}).

\subsection{mRNA Abundance}

Another mode that impacts the proteome is a change in mRNA abundance,
here the translated mRNA level changes to a similar magnitude as the
total mRNA level. For these mRNAs the translation efficiency is
unaltered, as the change in total mRNA levels explains the change in
translated mRNA levels. Nevertheless, as there are more (or less) mRNAs
being translated an effect the proteome is expected. The underlying
biological implication for this mode mRNAs is often related to
transcription or mRNA stability (\textbf{See figure \ref{modes}}).

\subsection{Translational buffering} \label{modeBuffering}

The third mode for regulation of gene expression is termed translational
buffering. Under this mode a change in total mRNA levels is observed,
whereas polysome-associated mRNA levels remain constant between
conditions. Translational buffering also reflects a change in
translation efficiency as the proportion of mRNAs to associated with
ribosomes is altered. In contrast to changes in translation and mRNA
abundance, translational buffering has been shown to maintain protein
homeostasis rather than reshape the proteome (Lalanne et al., 2018;
Lorent et al., 2019; C. J. McManus, May, Spealman, \& Shteyman, 2014).

Currently the literature supports multiple forms of translational
buffering. Translational buffering can compensate for differences in
mRNA levels due to e.g.~differences in gene dosages, so that protein
levels remain similar ({\textbf{???}}; Lalanne et al., 2018).
Furthermore, rather than compensating it can ``offset'' translation to
temporarily alter the mRNA:protein ratio in response to a stimulus
(Lorent et al., 2019).

Translational buffering in its compensation form has been observed at
steady state levels. A study comparing co evolution of transcription and
translation across seven different organs and mammals showed overall
greater divergence of transcription as compared to translation (Z.-Y.
Wang et al., 2020). Similar compensation at the level of translation has
been observed between individuals, tissues and prokaryotes
({\textbf{???}}; Artieri \& Fraser, 2014b; C. Cenik et al., 2015;
Lalanne et al., 2018; Perl et al., 2017).

Compensation via translational buffering can also enforce equilibration
of pathway or protein complex stoichometry (Lalanne et al., 2018; Li,
Burkhardt, Gross, \& Weissman, 2014). An example of this was observed in
evolutionary distant bacetria, i.e.~B. subtilis and E. coli. In B.
subtilis translation related factors rpsP and rplS are located in
different operons, whereas in E. coli they lie within an operon together
with rimM and trmD. While B. subtilis can fine tune transcription at the
different operons, in E. coli these will be transcribed together.
However, rimM and trmD are only needed in low protein abundance, whereas
rpsP and rplS are required in high abundance. E. coli compensates the
transcriptional input at the translational level and thus equilibriates
for requirements in pathway stoichometry (Lalanne et al., 2018).

As mentioned above a different form of translational buffering can be
observed in perturbed systems that offset changes in transcription at
the level of translation temporarily. For example, translational
offsetting was observed in prostate cancer cells where a transcriptional
program was induced under estrogen receptor \(\alpha\) (ER\(\alpha\))
depletion that was showed no increase in polysome-associated mRNA. mRNAs
whose transcription was translationally offset required the tRNA u34
modification. ER\(\alpha\) has been shown to regulate the expression of
the catalytic enzymes required for the u34 modification (Lorent et al.,
2019). Thus, depletion of ER\(\alpha\) led to that tRNAs could not be
properly modified at the U34 position and therefore the translation
efficiency of mRNAs requiring the modification was reduced despite
increased total mRNA levels. \newline
\section{Algorithms for analysis of changes in translation efficiencies}\label{algorithm}

Given multiple roles of mRNA translation to regulate the proteome via
translation, mRNA abundance and buffering it is critical to distinguish
them as their underlying mechanisms can have different biological
implications. In this section we will discuss methods that analyse
polysome-profiling and ribosome profiling data to estimate changes in
translation efficiencies across 2 or more conditions and how these
methods identify different modes of gene expression.

Initially analysis of transcriptome-wide translation studies used an
approach called the translation efficiency score (TE-score) that uses
the following equation:
\[\varDelta TE = \frac{\frac{P_{c2}}{T_{c2}}} {\frac{P_{c1}}{T_{c1}}}\\\]

This score is calculated the ratio of the ratios between
polysome-associated mRNA levels (P) divided by total mRNA levels (T)
within each condition (i.e.~C1 and C2). The TE- score approach has been
shown to be prone to spurious correlations (Larsson, Sonenberg, \&
Nadon, 2010). Spurious correlations arise due to that the ratio of
polysome-associated mRNA and total mRNA can systematically correlate
with total mRNA levels which is not corrected for in this equation and
leads to an elevated type-1 error.

\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:TE}} gives an overview of the relationship
between a change in TE-score and each gene expression mode (\textbf{see
also figure \ref{fig:modes}}). Changes in mRNA abundance will lead to a
\(\varDelta\)TE close to 0 in log space (i.e.~no change in translation
efficiency) as total mRNA and translated mRNA change with a similar
magnitude. However, in the case of both translation and translational
buffering, the nominator and denominator in the TE-score equation change
leading to a \(\varDelta\)TE (TE \textless{} 0 or TE \textgreater{} 0)
and thereby identification of both changes in translation and
translational buffering simultaneously. Therefore, the TE-score method
fails to differentiate between changes in translation and translational
buffering which can have drastic consequences for the biological
interpretation of the results (Oertlin et al., 2019) (\textbf{see also
section \ref{modes}}).

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{0.5\textwidth}

The shifts for the translation efficiency (TE) score are indicated. \label{fig:TE}}
\end{wrapfigure}

The TE-score approach was questioned when proposing the Analysis of
Translation Activity (anota) algorithm which was developed for
DNA-microarray data (Larsson et al., 2010). anota combines analysis of
partial variance (APV) (Schleifer, Eckholdt, Cohen, \& Keller, 1993)
with a random variance model (RVM) (G. W. Wright \& Simon, 2003). RVM
estimates gene variance using shared information across all genes to
increase power for detection of differential expression (G. W. Wright \&
Simon, 2003). anota uses a two-step process that firstly assesses the
model assumptions for (i) absence of highly influential data points,
(ii) samples classes sharing a common slope, (iii) homoscedasticity of
residuals and (iv) normal distribution of per gene residuals. In the
second step anota performs analysis of changes in translational activity
using the following model:

\[y_{gi} = \beta_g^{RNA}\ X_i^{RNA}+ \beta_g^{cond}\ X_i^{cond} + \varepsilon_{gi}\]

here \(y_{gi}\) is the polysome associated mRNA expression,
\(\beta_g^{RNA}\) describes the relationship to total RNA for the
\(gth\) gene of the \(ith\) sample column of model matrix \(X\);
\(\beta_g^{cond}\) represent the difference in intercept between
treatment classes and \(\varepsilon_{gi}\) denotes the residual error.

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{0.5\textwidth}
  \includegraphics{./figures/geneModes_anota_Larsson.pdf}
  \caption{anota gene models - Schematic representation of the anota analysis models. Translation mRNA expression is set out against total mRNA expression for each biological replicate and treatment condition. Top left shows the model of a gene that is deferentially translated (i.e. change in translated but not total mRNA). The difference in the slope intercepts are used to estimate changes in translation efficiencies between conditions i.e. dTE. Other gene models are shown; change in translation efficiency with varying total mRNA levels (top right); change in mRNA abundance (bottom left) and translational buffering (bottom right).
  \label{fig:anota}}
\end{wrapfigure}

Within anota a common slope for the treatment classes that describes the
translated mRNA to total mRNA relationship is calculated. The difference
between the slope intercepts is then interpreted as the change in
translation efficiency. A simplified view of this model can be seen in
(\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:anota} top left}). Here expression for
translated mRNA and total mRNA are modeled over two sample classes with
each 4 replicates. Furthermore, changes in translation efficiencies can
also be observed when translated mRNAs shift to a larger extent than the
total mRNA levels (\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:anota} top right}).
Identification of genes in this category can be a challenge, especially
in highly variable data sets, as they resemble mRNA abundance genes
(\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:anota} bottom left}). Nevertheless, using the
linear regression analysis anota accurately corrects changes in
translated mRNA as can be seen in (\textbf{Figure \ref{fig:anota} bottom
right}) where a change in total mRNA but not translated mRNA levels is
observed. For this gene the difference in slope intercepts between
sample classes is small and will not be identified as differentially
translated as would be the case in the TE-score approach. anota was
developed at a time where translational buffering was not considered in
data sets. Naturally, the methods lacks a setting to analyse
translational buffering. This was addressed in anota's successor,
anota2seq, and will be discussed in \textbf{Study 1}.

Advances in experimental methods warrant for appropriate statistical
methods to analyse data resulting from them. DNA-microarray was the
dominant platform to assess transcriptome-wide changes before the advent
of RNA sequencing. DNA-microarrays measure intensity after hybridisation
events is an indicator of expression, whereas in RNA sequencing reads of
constructed libraries are counted. Intensity data from DNA-microarray
can be normalised and transformed (i.e.~log transformation) to fulfill
the requirements for application of linear models, whereas RNA
sequencing harbours additional characteristics that need to be accounted
for. Therefore, algorithms developed for analysis of DNA- microarray are
not directly applicable to RNA sequencing data as is the case for the
anota algorithm.

RNA sequencing data shows variance that is greater than the mean which
is commonly referred to as overdispersion. Count data from RNA
sequencing have been initially approached using Poisson distributions
which assumes that the variance is equal to the mean (J. Lu et al.,
2005). Now established RNA sequencing analysis frameworks such as edgeR
and DESeq2 use negative binomial distributions in combination with
generalised linear models (GLMs) (Love, Huber, \& Anders, 2014;
Robinson, McCarthy, \& Smyth, 2010). The negative binomial distribution
uses a dispersion parameter to account for differences in the
mean-variance relationship across the expression range (McCarthy, Chen,
\& Smyth, 2012). While analysis principles of DESeq2 and edgeR are
similar they differ in their normalisation method, dispersion estimation
and information sharing across genes. In a simple differential
expression analysis between two conditions with one RNA type the GLM
model would be as in the following equation:

\[log(y_{gi}) = \beta_g^{cond}\ X_i^{cond} + \varepsilon_{gi}\]

here \(\beta_g^{cond}\ X_i^{cond}\) represent the condition
(i.e.~control and treatment) log2 fold change for the \(gth\) gene
\(ith\) sample column of the model matrix X and \(\varepsilon_{gi}\)
denotes the residual error. When analysing changes in translation
effiencies additional parameter for RNA type (i.e.~total mRNA or
translated mRNA) and the interaction between the RNA type and condition
are added so that:

\[log(y_{gi}) = \beta_g^{RNA}\ X_i^{RNA}+ \beta_g^{cond}\ X_i^{cond} + \beta_g^{RNA:cond}\ X_i^{interaction} + \varepsilon_gi\]

In this model the interaction term is interpreted as the change in
translation effiencies (Chothani et al., 2019). Other methods
(i.e.~Ribodiff (Zhong et al., 2017), Riborex (W. Li, Wang, Uren,
Penalva, \& Smith, 2017) and deltaTE (Chothani et al., 2019)) borrow
this analysis principle of an GLM with an interaction term by applying
this exact model. A notable difference is that Ribodiff allows
dispersion estimation for translated mRNA and total mRNA separately as
variance differences between the RNA types can be expected due to
varying experimental protocols (Liang et al., 2018; Zhong et al., 2017).
While the flexibility of GLMs allows for complex study designs involving
2 or more treatment conditions, Riborex and Ribodiff limit the study
design to only two conditions. DeltaTE gives their users full
flexibility of the DESeq2 GLM model. Xtail is a method developed for
ribosome profiling that makes use of DESeq2 for RNAseq count
normalisation (Z. Xiao, Zou, Liu, \& Yang, 2016). Their assessment of
differences in translation efficiencies relies on probability matrices
for the ratio of translated mRNA over total mRNA within condition and a
between condition ratio of these ratios. Babel was the first algorithm
designed solely for analysis of differential translation and uses an
error-in-variables regression analysis (A. B. Olshen et al., 2013). The
error-in- variables regression allows accounting for variable total mRNA
levels when assessing changes in translation. Although these methods
have distinct approaches to identify changes in translation
efficiencies, their principle of analysis is similar to comparing a
ratio of ratios (see TE-score equation above). Therefore these methods
suffer from similar issues as the TE-score which will be discussed in
\textbf{Study 1}.

\chapter{Aims of this thesis}

The aims of this thesis are to expand current methodologies for analysis
of translation efficiency data and explore the regulation of gene
expression in cancer.

In \textbf{Study I} we adapted the ANalysis Of Translation Activity data
(anota) algorithm so that it could be applied to next generation
sequencing data. Furthermore, we implemented the analysis of
translational buffering a recently described regulatory mode of gene
expression. The resulting algorithm was named anota2seq.

We then applied the anota2seq algorithm to investigate changes in
translation efficiencies in two cancer models:

In \textbf{Study II} we unraveled the effects of eIF4A, an RNA helicase,
inhibition using a synthetic rocaglate CR-1-31-B (CR-31) in pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma.

In \textbf{Study III} we explored the effects of insulin on gene
expression in multiple cell lines.

\chapter{Results and discussion}

\section{Study 1 - Generally applicable transcriptome-wide analysis of translation using anota2seq}

Initially changes in translation efficiencies were estimated using the
TE-score approach as outlined in section \ref{algorithm}. However, this
method was being shown to be prone to spurious correlations leading to
elevated false positive identification that can result in false
biological conclusions (Larsson et al., 2010). Spurious correlations,
when using the TE-score, can be attributed the inadequate correction for
changes in total mRNA levels when estimating translation efficiencies
(Larsson et al., 2010; Larsson, Sonenberg, \& Nadon, 2011). The Analysis
of Translation Activity (anota) algorithm facilitates analysis of
translational efficiencies that are corrected for changes in total mRNA
levels (Larsson et al., 2011).

anota was developed for analysis of transcriptome-wide analysis for data
quantified by DNA- microarrays (Larsson et al., 2010). However, advances
in experimental methodologies lead to the development in RNA sequencing.
RNA sequencing and DNA microarray data have distinct characteristics
that need to be accounted for before analysis (\textbf{see section
\ref{algorithm}}). Therefore, while the statistical framework of anota
had been shown as an adequate approach for analysis of translational
efficiencies for data from DNA microarrays it was not directly
applicable to RNA sequencing data. The characteristic of RNA sequencing
data, that makes applying anota directly not possible, is the mean
variance relationship. This encompasses that the counts for lower
expressed genes show higher variability than counts for higher expressed
genes even after log transformation. Efforts have been made to make RNA
sequencing data more ``DNA- microarray like'' so that algorithms
developed for intensity based microarray data can be applied to count
based RNA sequencing data (Law, Chen, Shi, \& Smyth, 2014; Love et al.,
2014). Anota2seq, the algorithm developed in this study, allows for
transformation and normalisation of RNA sequencing data so that the
anota statistical frame work can be applied for analysis of count data.

Another feature of anota2seq is that it allows for statistical analysis
of translational buffering. The need for the analysis of translational
buffering, or the uncoupling of transcription from translation, has been
noted before anota2seq's development by comparing 20 translatomes and
transcriptomes with different underlying stimuli in mammalian cells
(Tebaldi et al., 2012). The same authors proposed a framework, called
tRanslatome, that combines several methodologies for analysis of
differential transcription and translation efficiencies, including
anota, for a comprehensive analysis of transcription and translation as
well as their underlying mechanisms (Tebaldi, Dassi, Kostoska, Viero, \&
Quattrone, 2014).

\begin{wrapfigure}{o}{0.5\textwidth}
  \includegraphics{./figures/geneModes_anota2seq.pdf}
  \caption{anota2seq gene model for analysis of translational buffering /offsetting - Total mRNA expression is set out against translated mRNA expression for each biological replicate and treatment condition. The model shows total mRNA changes that are independent of translated mRNA changes which is classified as translational buffering. It is important to distinguish between the gene modes as their regulation could be due to different underlying biological mechanisms (see section \ref{modes}).
  \label{fig:anota2seq}}
\end{wrapfigure}

Nevertheless, commonly observed in polysome and ribosome profiling data
sets are three gene expression modes, translation, translational
buffering and mRNA abundance. While anota can be used to identify genes
among the translation and mRNA abundance mode, analysis for
translational buffering was not implemented therein (\emph{See Figure
\ref{fig:anota}}). Therefore, one would need to rely on the integration
of several methods to efficiently analyse transcriptome-wide studies of
translation efficiences. Anota2seq addresses this issue by changing the
analysis model as described in section \ref{algorithm} to analyse
changes in total mRNA levels corrected for changes in translated mRNA
levels (i.e.~translational buffering, \textbf{see figure
\ref{fig:anota2seq}}).

Appliance of anota2seq has successfully identified translational
buffering to which biological mechanisms could be linked, e.g.~as
mentioned earlier translationally bufferring under ER\(\alpha\)
depletion in prostate cancer (\textbf{see section \ref{modeBuffering}})
(Lorent et al., 2019). Furthermore, in \textbf{study 2} translational
buffering can be observed as a compensating mechanisms in ``healthy''
cells upon treatment with an eIF4A inhibitor and in \textbf{study 3} we
identify mTOR dependent translational buffering for mRNAs with certain
3' UTR characteristics.

The aim of this study was to compare anota2seq's performance to other
established algorithms (i.e.~DESeq2, RiboDiff, babel, TE-score and
Xtail) for analysis of translation efficiencies, specifically their
ability to distinguish the three prominent modes of gene expression. To
achieve this we used simulated data. While it is arguable to what extent
conclusion drawn from simulated data can be extended towards empirical
data it allows for a controlled environment where true positive changes
are known in advance. Furthermore, the mean-variance relationship in the
simulated data is based on a real polysome profiling data set to
increase confidence that drawn conclusions are also applicable to
empirical data (Guan et al., 2017). Furthermore, during testing of our
simulation we used an additional data set to estimate parameters from to
generate data sets. Using these simulated data to compare the
performance of the above mentioned algorithms showed almost identical
results.

The simulated data consisted of four replicates for translated mRNA and
total mRNA with a ``control'' and a ``treatment'' condition.
Furthermore, the data sets contained a combination of the following gene
sets:

\emph{``Unchanged''}: For this simulation category we sampled reads from
the same NB distribution for both the control and treatment conditions
in both the translated and total mRNA. This category represents genes
that would be unaffected by e.g.~a stimulus of between cellular states.

\emph{``mRNA abundance''}: For this category the control condition for
both the translated mRNA and total mRNA were sampled from the same NB
distribution. The NB distribution for \textbf{both translated mRNA and
total mRNA} of the treatment condition was altered so that values would
be drawn corresponding to a fold change (negative or positive) ranging
between 1.5 to 3.0. The directionality of the fold changes (i.e.~up or
down regulation) was the same for translated mRNA and total mRNA.

\emph{``translation''}: For this category the control condition for both
the translated mRNA and total mRNA were samled from the same NB
distribution. The NB distribution for \textbf{translated mRNA only} of
the treatment condition was altered so that values would be drawn
corresponding to a fold change (negative or positive) ranging between
1.5 to 3.0.

\emph{``buffering''}: For this category the control condition for both
the translated mRNA and total mRNA were sampled from the same NB
distribution. The NB distribution for \textbf{total mRNA only} of the
treatment condition was altered so that values would be drawn
corresponding to a fold change (negative or positive) ranging between
1.5 to 3.0.

As a first step we tested whether the methods could properly control for
type-1 errors (i.e.~false positive identification). For this we
simulated a data set with genes belonging only to the ``unchanged''
category. This revealed that babel, but to an even greater extent Xtail,
were unable to control their type-1 error as these methods assigned low
p-values and FDRs when no real changes were present. DESeq2 was
marginally affected by this also. This indicated a limited applicability
of Xtail and babel for statistical analysis of translatomes.

From the comparative analysis of the analysis for changes in translation
efficiencies affecting protein levels we concluded that anota2seq
outperforms all other methods. This was assessed by comparing the area
under the curve from Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and
precision recall curves. The ROC curves showed a, albeit slightly,
better performance for detecting changes in translation. However, the
precision recall was much higher for anota2seq which can be accredited
to that the analysis principle of the other methods is based on
identifying changes regardless of whether the change is in the
translated mRNA or total mRNA (\emph{as explained in section
\ref{algorithm}}). Nevertheless, when comparing the performance using
simulated data in the absence of genes belonging to the ``buffering''
category anota2seq still showed superior performance.

Next to the a prior knowledge of the introduced changes in the
simulation data, it also allowed us to modify parameters to investigate
the robustness of the methods to increased variance, overall sequencing
depth and differing sequencing depth between samples. Here, all methods
showed robustness against variance and sequencing depth differences
between samples as long as a minimum of 5 million counts per sample was
reached.

A shortcoming in the simulation study is that we did not assess the
effects of systematic batch effects. Batch effects can be introduced
e.g.~during experimental design and there are many methods that try to
correct for these (W. E. Johnson, Li, \& Rabinovic, 2007; Leek, 2014; Y.
Zhang, Parmigiani, \& Johnson, 2020). Other ways to correct for batch
effects is their inclusion in the analysis model, which can be supplied
to the analysis model in DESeq2, edgeR as well as anota2seq. Indeed
analysis of a dataset with prominent batch effects showed that batch
effects can dampen the efficiency of the anota2seq algorithm to identify
changes but can be effectively corrected for in the algorithm.

In this study we developed an analysis algorithm for efficient
transcriptome-wide analysis of translation efficiencies applicable to
DNA-microarrays and RNA seq. Furthermore, anota2seq has been
successfully applied to broaden the knowledge around mRNA translation in
various different contexts (Chan et al., 2019; Chaparro et al., 2020;
Hipolito et al., 2019; Lorent et al., 2019). \newline
\section{Study 2 - eIF4A supports an oncogenic translation program in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma}

Pancreatic cancer is considered a lethal malignancy and has limited
treatment options. A study on predictions for european cancer mortality
rates for 2021 concluded that health efforts should focus on pancreatic
cancer. While other cancers (e.g.~ovary, breast and stomach) showed a
decline in mortality rates, no major overall decline was observed for
pancreatic cancer in the period of 1970-2021 (Carioli et al., 2021).

Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) accounts for over 90\% of
exocrine pancreatic cancer, whereas non ductal pancreatic cancers
e.g.~acinar cell carcinomas are uncommon (Feldmann, Beaty, Hruban, \&
Maitra, 2007; Jun \& Hong, 2016). It is estimated the 60-70\% of the
PDAs arise in the head of the pancreas (Luchini, Capelli, \& Scarpa,
2016). So far treatment options are mostly limited to surgical removal,
which often is impossible due to the anatomical location of the pancreas
head.

With the increasing understanding of tumor heterogeneity, i.e.~tumors
with similar tissue origin are diverse at a molecular level, anti cancer
therapy improved (Biankin \& Hudson, 2011). In breast cancer
stratification by histological, molecular and gene expression features
identified several breast cancer subtypes for which different treatment
options exist, e.g. \(ER^+\) breast cancer subtypes respond to endocrine
therapy, whereas \(ER^-\) do not (Andre \& Pusztai, 2006; Parker et al.,
2009). While breast cancer treatment strategies benefit from a rather
well established understanding of the molecular subtypes, in pancreatic
cancer transcriptomic based subtyping is still ongoing (P. Bailey et
al., 2016; Collisson, Bailey, Chang, \& Biankin, 2019; Collisson et al.,
2011; Moffitt et al., 2015; Puleo et al., 2018). Therefore, it is
warranted to extend current knowledge around pancreatic cancer to
advance therapeutic strategies in this lethal disease.

While intricacies of molecular subtypes are still being investigated,
research has shown that oncogenic mutations in KRAS as well as
inactivation of tumor suppressor TP53 are commonly shared among PDAs (S.
Jones et al., 2008). Furthermore, PDAs have been shown to be dependent
on increased protein synthesis mediated by KRAS (Chio et al., 2016).
This indicates an important role of mRNA translation in PDA.

The aim of \emph{study 2} was to investigate the therapeutic effects of
targeting eIF4A in a three dimensional PDA organoid cell culture with
mutations in the \(Kras^{LSL-G12D}\), \(Trp53^{LSL-R172H}\) and Pdx1-cre
alleles that has been shown to recapitulate PDA tumor progression (Boj
et al., 2015). The inhibition of eIF4A was done using a synthetic
rocaglate, CR-31. Rocaglates have been shown to inhibit eIF4A helicase
activity and displayed anti tumor activity (Cencic et al., 2009).

We first wanted to establish the therapeutic validity of targeting eIF4A
in PDA. \emph{In vitro} experiments comparing treated PDA organoids (KP)
to their normal (N) counter parts revealed heightened sensitivity of KP
to CR-31 treatment. OP-puromycin incorporation showed reduced protein
synthesis in KP, whereas N were affected to a lesser extent.
Furthermore, similar effects were found \emph{in vivo} for PDA tumours.
Here CR-31 reduced protein synthesis (assessed by SUnSET assay), tumor
growth (assessed by ultra sound imaging) and increased survival. The
effect on protein synthesis was not due to inhibition of oncogenic
signalling pathways which was evaluated western blot assessing the
phosphorylation of e.g.~AKT, mTOR and 4E-BP1. From these findings we
concluded that there is therapeutic validity in targeting eIF4A in PDA
that acts downstream of oncogenic signalling pathways.

Using polysome profiling we then sought to decipher the mechanisms
explaining the increased sensitivity to CR-31 in KP organoids. First we
investigated the differences in gene expression between untreated KP and
N organoids. Analysis of changes in translation efficiencies using
anota2seq revealed massive modulation at both transcription and
translation indicative of underlying differences in e.g.~genomic
stability and enhanced oncogenic signalling impinging on protein
synthesis reported in PDA (Boj et al., 2015). Consistent with the
\emph{in vitro} OP-puromycin incorporation and \emph{in vivo} SUNsET
experiments, CR-31 had only little effect on translation in N organoids,
whereas in KP organoids ample changes in translation were detected.

We then compared the mRNAs affected by CR-31 in KP to the acquired
translational profile of untreated KP and N organoids. In order to
achieve this we visualised the mRNAs affected by CR-31 in KP onto the
data of the untreated KP vs N organoids comparison. This revealed that
the acquired translational program of KP organoids is reversed when
treated with CR-31.

Performing a similar analysis, we visualised mRNAs sensitive to CR-31 in
KP onto the data of the CR-31 treated N organoids. mRNAs affected by
CR-31 in KP were translationally offset in CR-31 treated N organoids.
Translational buffering, as an adaptive response to treatment, has been
shown to maintain protein homeostasis by inducing a transcriptional
response increasing the pool of mRNAs that can be translated (Lorent et
al., 2019). The ability for N organoids in increase transcription for
mRNAs affected by CR-31, whereas KP cannot, could partially explain as
to why protein synthesis is not reduced to a similar extent in N as in
KP.

We then assessed 5' UTR characteristics of the translationally regulated
mRNAs upon CR-31 treatment in KP organoids. It was reported that
eIF4A-senstive mRNAs showed overall and more structured 5' UTRs
(e.g.~containing G-quadruplexes) ({\textbf{???}}; Rubio et al., 2014;
Wolfe et al., 2014). Furthermore, a mechanisms by which rocaglates would
clamp eIF4A to mRNAs with {[}A,G{]} repeats in their 5 UTR was described
(Iwasaki, Floor, \& Ingolia, 2016). However, mRNAs sensitive to CR-31
treatment herein showed overall shorter 5' UTRs that were more
structured when corrected for their length without enrichment for
4G-quadruplexes or {[}A,G{]} repeats. From the polysome profiling and
UTR analysis we concluded that eIF4A supports an oncogenic translation
program in PDA cells for mRNAs with shorter but structured 5' UTRs.

Shorter 5' UTRs have been shown to be sensitive to eIF4E expression and
encode for metabolic functions (see section \ref{regmRNA}). When we
compared an eIF4E overexpression signature in the KP vs N and CR-31
treated KP we observed that in KP organoids translationally regulated
mRNAs under eIF4E overexpression were also translationally activated.
This observation is consistent with reports of 4E-BP1 loss in pancreatic
cancer (Y. Martineau et al., 2014). eIF4A inhibition in tumors resistant
to mTOR inhibiton by loss of 4E-BP1 has been shown to circumvent this
resistance (D. M√ºller et al., 2019). Indeed, CR-31 treatment in KP
reversed the translational profile for eIF4E sensitive mRNAs. Therefore,
while rocaglates have been shown to directly target eIF4A (Cencic et
al., 2009), eIF4F complex formation could be disrupted by reduced eIF4A
availability to an extent that eIF4E dependent translation is affected
in PDA organoids herein.

When further inspecting the regulated gene sets in treated and untreated
KP compared to their normal counterparts we could see an enrichment in
metabolic pathways, e.g.~Oxidative phosphorylation. This pathway was
upregulated at the polysome associated RNA levels in untreated KP
compared to N, whereas in KP CR-31 treatment reversed the translational
profile of this pathway. Indeed, when we measured mitochondrial
respiration (by oxygen consumption rates) we found that CR-31 treatment
in KP disrupted this process, whereas N organoids where affected to a
lesser extent.

A way to counter loss of energy production through oxidative
phosphorylation is to increase activity of other anaerobic metabolic
pathways, i.e.~glycolysis. However, in CR-31 treated KP we could not
detect a upregulation of glycolysis measured by \(U-C^{13}\) glucose
labeling and extra cellular acidification rates nor did CR-31 treatment
affect expression of glycolytic enzymes (e.g.~HK1,HK2, LDHA, SLCA1,
SLCA3). Furthermore, glucose deprivation did not further sensitise to
CR-31 treatment. This was rather unexpected, given that increased
glycolysis is characteristic for cancers as described by Otto walburg
(Warburg, Wind, \& Negelein, 1927). However, the polysome prolfing data
revealed translational downregulation and subsequent reduction of
protein expression for the glucose transporter Slc2a6. Indeed,
perturbation of Slc2a6 using \(sgRNA^{Slc2a6}\) in N and KP organoids
revealed a decrease in glucose uptake. From this we concluded that
glycolytic compensation of KP is diminished by translational regulation
of the glucose transporter Slc2a6 upon CR-31 treatment.

Among the translationally activated genes in the CR-31 treated KP
organoids where mRNAs involved in the glutamine metabolism (i.e.~Slc1a5
and Gls1). Furthermore, glutamine levels were elevated in patient
derived PDA cell lines treated with CR-31. Glutamine can be converted
into \(\alpha\)-ketoglutarate and funneled into the krebs cycle and
therefore can serve to increase energy production (D. Xiao et al.,
2016). Indeed, using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC/MS) to
quantify metabolites after culturing PDA cells in \(C_5^{13}\)-
glutamine, we identified a shift towards reductive carboxylation of
\(\alpha\)-ketoglutarate obtained from \(C_5^{13}\)- glutamine to
produce acetyl-CoA. Notably, the glutamine metabolism was not elevated
in N organoids.

A combined treatment of CR-31 with glutaminase inhibitors (BPTES or
CB839) could sensitise to CR-31 treatment patient-derived PDA cells to
CR-31 treatment. Therefore, our study suggests an eIF4A dependent
translational program in PDA that can act as a theurapeutic target in
PDA. Furthermore, a recently published ribosome profiling study of a
CR-31 treated human pancreatic cancer cell line (PANC1) observed the
same therapeutic effect of CR-31 treatment \emph{in vivo} on survival
and tumor volume (Singh et al., 2021). This underlines the significance
of our study in identifying eIF4A as therapeutic target in PDA.

Nevertheless, the same study indicated differences on the underlying
regulated mRNA subsets (Singh et al., 2021). They report, in line with
the literature, that eIF4A depdent mRNAs show long and structured 5'
UTRs containing \(GGC_4\) sequence motifs they propose to form
G-quadruplexes (Singh et al., 2021; Wolfe et al., 2014). While the 5'
UTRs of the mRNAs identified herein where overall shorter, they were
overall more structured. Also, the mRNAs identifed in Singh et. al. were
involved in KRAS signalling, which was unaltered in our study.
Furthermore, Singh et. al. chose to use ribosome profiling in their
study that provides nucleotide resolution of ribosome occupancy (Singh
et al., 2021). The nucleotide resolution of ribosome profiling could
give insights whether ribosomes stall at G-quadruplex sites. Yet, the
authors did not exploit this feature of their applied experimental
methodology. Furthermore, studies indicate that the presence of
G-quadruplex sites do not mean that they will form in the cell (Weldon,
Eperon, \& Dominguez, 2016). Indeed, Waldron et. al. showed that
\(GGC_4\) structures fail to form G-quadruplexes in reporter mRNAs.
However, classical hairpin secondary structures would form from these
sequences and thus classical structures dictate eIF4A dependency
(Waldron et al., 2018).

This raises some questions about the differences between experimental
setups and their potential influence on biological outcomes and
interpretation thereof. For instance, Singh et. al. performed ribosome
profiling on a PANC1 cell line culture treated with 25nM CR-31, wheres
herein we performed polysome profiling on a 3D-organoid culture treated
with 10nM CR-31. The differences between ribosome and polysome profiling
have been discussed extensively (see section \ref{exptMethod}).
Furthermore, by measuring IC50 concentrations for CR-31 in a panel of
pancreatic cancer cell lines, Singh et. al. show a
\textasciitilde{}6-fold difference in susceptability to CR-31 between
the cell lines of which PANC1 cells were most sensitive to CR-31. Dosage
dependent viability experiments of patient derived PDA cells in our
study revealed that at 10nM CR-31 treatment cell viability was reduced
by \textasciitilde{}30\%, whereas treatment with 25nM reduced viability
by \textgreater{} 50\%. Furthermore, in patient derived PDA a
combination treatment of CR-31 and CB839 showed no synergistic effects
at 25nM CR-31, whereas at 12.50nM synergy was observed. Therefore,
combining the findings of these two studies indicate that CR-31
treatment in PDA indeed has a therapeutic effect, however the underlying
mechanisms that are observed in the transcriptome wide analysis of
translation efficiencies could be dependent on the experimental method
to assess mRNA translation, the model system and drug concentrations.

\section{Study 3 - mTOR-dependent translational buffering overrides transcriptome alterations leading to
maintained proteome composition}

Breast cancer is an umbrella term for a heterogeneous disease with
numerous molecular subtypes with different clinical behaviour.
Currently, breast cancer is classified into five major groups; luminal
A, luminal B, HER-2, basal and normal like. The classification is based
on histopatholgy and receptor status. Histopathological are determined
by the degree of tumor differentiation (tubule formation), nuclear
pleomorphism and proliferation (mitotic count). These features are then
scored into a histological grade (I-III) (Eliyatkin, Yal√ßin, Zengel,
Akta≈ü, \& Vardar, 2015). As mentioned earlier, receptor status of the
progesterone (PR), estrogen (ER) and HER-2 are evaluated and have
implications for neo adjuvant and adjuvant treatment strategies.
Advances in technologies lead to classification of breast cancer
subtypes using gene expression profiles,e.g.~the PAM50 classification,
that allow for unbiased classification of breast cancer (Parker et al.,
2009). A study that correlated the gene expression profiles of the PAM50
classification found a significanlty higher mRNA:protein correlation for
PAm50 genes, indicating their prognostic value (Johansson et al., 2019).
Nevertheless, the authors observed intermixed luminal B and HER2
clustering based on protein expression in line with the literature that
HER2 subtypes receive conflicting mRNA based classifications (Johansson
et al., 2019; Prat et al., 2014). Thus, the understanding of breast
cancer subtypes has increased tremendously leading to improved and
targeted treatment options, however there is need for further research
to understand the full breast cancer spectrum on a molecular level.

Another important factor to consider in breast cancer treatment are life
style and other health related issues that could impact cancer
progression or response to treatment, e.g.~obesity. Studies in the 1970
observed unfavorable prognosis for breast cancer in obese women (Abe,
Kumagai, Kimura, Hirosaki, \& Nakamura, 1976). More recent studies
observed endocrine therapy to be less effective in obese patients and
increased cancer incidence in individuals with higher weight or lack of
physical activity (Eheman et al., 2012; K. Lee, Kruper, Dieli-Conwright,
\& Mortimer, 2019). Obesity can pose an increased risk to develop
metabolic disorders such as metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes that
can lead to hyperinsulinemia, i.e.~elevated physiological insulin levels
(Saltiel, 2001).

The role of insulin in the body is to regulate glucose and lipid
metabolism as well as protein synthesis. Protein synthesis and
metaboloism are often dysregulated in cancer (Hanahan \& Weinberg, 2011;
Saltiel, 2001). Insulin can bind to both IGF1R and INSR that activate
the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/ERK signalling pathways. A role of insulin in
cancer progression has initially been observed in long term tissues
cultures where it increased metabolism as well as growth (Osborne,
Bolan, Monaco, \& Lippman, 1976). Another growth factor that is similar
to insulin is IGF1 which acts to the same receptors as insulin. IGF1
plays a role in cancer progression and its levels are elevated upon
hyperinsulinemia (Bailyes et al., 1997; Christopoulos, Msaouel, \&
Koutsilieris, 2015; Gallagher \& LeRoith, 2010; A. Molinaro et al.,
2019).

The importance of both IGF1 and insulin signalling in cancer has been
well established now and led to development of therapeutic strategies by
e.g.~targeting both IGF1R and INSR or the PI3K signalling pathway
(Kuijjer et al., 2013; Mayer et al., 2017). Yet, to this day the full
extent of insulin signalling on gene expression in cancer has not been
investigated. This study aims to bridge this gap in knowledge by
elucidating the effects of insulin signalling on gene expression using a
multi-omics (including transcriptomics, translatomics and proteomics)
approach to capture multiple steps of the gene expression pathway
simultaneously. Furthermore, we asses insulin signalling in cancer cells
as well as non-transformed epithelial cells.

We first investigated the effects of insulin on gene expression in a
luminal A breast cancer cell line, i.e.~MCF7 cells. Polysome-profiling
revealed a strong transcripional and translational response upon insulin
stimulation. Among the translationally activated mRNAs were mRNAs with
short 5' UTRs that harboured TOP motifs which is n accordance that
insulin signalling leads to activation of mTORC1 and phosphorylation of
its downstream targets. When visualising the mRNAs in the data where
MCF7 cells were stimulated with insulin in the presence of torin1, an
mTOR active site inhibitor, we observed that the changes in mRNA
translation were almost fully reversed. This led to the conclusion that
the effects of insulin on gene expression are to a great extent
dependent on mTOR activity.

What was surprising to us was the observation that a subset of mRNAs
exhibited translational buffering upon insulin stimulation while mTOR is
inhibited. For these mRNAs, the total mRNA levels were increased,
whereas the polysome-association was unaltered between conditions
effectively uncoupling transcription from translation. As has been seen
by others, we confirm that translationally buffered mRNAs maintain
constant protein expression across conditions using HiRIEF LC/MS (R. M.
M. Branca et al., 2014; Lorent et al., 2019). These findings indicate
that mTOR can act as a gatekeeper for transcriptional programs to fine
tune translation in response to extra cellular or intra cellular
signals.

MCF7 cells are of epithelial origin and therefore not ``classical''
insulin sensitive such as adipose tissue or muscle cells. Their strong
response to insulin prompted us to investigate whether this could be due
to cellular plasticity in cancer. To assess this we chose to compare the
effects found in MCF7 to a non-malignant epithelial cell type, i.e.~HMEC
cells. We found that insulin alone was not sufficient to stimulate the
PI3k/AKT/mTOR pathway in HMEC to a similar extent as in MCF7. However, a
combination treatment of insulin and IGF1 in HMEC cells elicited a
similar reponse as insulin treatment in MCF7 alone. Furthermore, it is
known that during hyperinsulinemia IGF1 levels are increased and both
IGF1 and insulin signalling has been associated with cancer (Gallagher
\& LeRoith, 2010). We therefore opted to compare the combined insulin +
IGF1 treatment in HMEC to that of MCF7 assuming their signalling
cascades are nearly identical as proposed in the literature (Boucher,
Tseng, \& Kahn, 2010; Pollak, 2008).

Polysome profiling of the insulin + IGF1 stimulated HMEC cells revealed
a strong translational response, but was lacking the transcriptional
activation found in MCF7 cells. Translationally activated mRNAs in HMEC
showed 5' UTR features similar to those in MCF7 cells. Consequently,
their translational activation was dependent on mTOR signalling evident
from their translational suppression under conditions when mTOR was
inhibited during insulin + IGF stimulation. Furthermore, comparing the
mRNA signatures of HMEC and MCF7 in the opposite cell line we observed
that changes at the level of translation were almost fully in accord
across cell types.

In contrast to MCF7 cells, HMEC did not elicit a strong transcriptional
response as shown by the small number of changes in mRNA abundance.
However, when comparing a recently described transcription signature
induced after INSR translocation to the nucleus, we could see that in
both HMEC and MCF7 these mRNA show changes in total mRNA levels but of
differing magnitude (Hancock et al., 2019). A possible explanation for
the different response in transcription could be due to differences in
chromosome instability between the cell lines that expose different
parts of the DNA to trans acting factors. While not assessed herein, a
transcription factor analysis paired with chromatin immunoprecipitation
(ChIP) sequencing could provide insight into this (P. J. Park, 2009;
Solomon, Larsen, \& Varshavsky, 1988). Assuming a consequence of having
a weaker transcriptional response, HMEC cells did not elicit
translational buffering upon insulin + IGF1 stimulation when mTOR was
inhibited. Thus the effects of insulin and IGF1 signalling on mRNA
translation are foremost mTOR dependent, however total mRNA responses
differ between malignant and non-malignant epithelial cells.

The translational buffering in MCF7 prompted us to investigate this
phenomenon more. To assess differences dependent on mRNA characteristics
we defined two subsets. The ``reversed'' and the ``uncoupled'' (that is
translationally buffered when mTOR is inhibited) subsets that only
differed in their total mRNA response when mTOR was inhibited during
insulin stimulation. To rule out that the observed effects on total mRNA
are technical artifacts we validated total mRNA levels for two genes
from each subset. The differences in regulation of gene expression were
not dependent on codon usage which has been described before in a
different context (Lorent et al., 2019). However, overall uncoupled
mRNAs had shorter 3' UTRs with a higher GC content and were depleted for
HuR binding sites.

The depletion of HuR binding sites in the 3' UTRs of the uncoupled
subset prompted us to investigate mRNA stability differences. Using a
time series experiment under actinomycin D treatment to block
transcription quantified using nanoString, we found significant longer
mRNA half lifes for the uncoupled subset as compared to the reversed
subset. From these data we hypothesised that there are different
underlying mechanisms that regulate gene expression under conditions
where mRNA translation is dampened between these subsets. Under this
hypothesis the reversed subset is likely regulated through mRNA
stability, whereas the more stable uncoupled subset requires to be
regulated by translation as their total mRNA level remains high for
longer periods of time.

The involvement of HuR in this cannot be fully supported with our
current data as the analysis only supports a correlation between the
occurrence of HuR binding sites and the 3' UTRs of the reversed subset.
The effect on stability could be due to other trans acting factors such
as miRNAs (Valinezhad Orang, Safaralizadeh, \& Kazemzadeh-Bavili, 2014).
A way to increase confidence is to investigate HuRs involvement
experimentally, e.g.~we could use a single guide (sgRNA) to silence HuR
and measure total mRNA levels of the reversed and uncoupled mRNAs
previously validated by qPCR. If HuR is involved, we would expect that
the reversed mRNAs retain higher total mRNA levels under the condition
where mTOR is inhibited during insulin stimulation in MCF7 cells as
compared to control. Furthermore, while the differences in total mRNA
levels between the insulin and the insulin and torin1 treated conditions
in the RNAseq data imply a treatment effect on the mRNA stability we did
not observe this in the time chase experiment quantified by nanoString.
This raises the question whether the transcription block induced by
actinomycin D could influence the regulation of mRNA stability between
treatments. We could address this by including actinomycin D in the
sgHuR experiment and see if effects thereof differ or an experiment
independent of sgHuR. Presence of such an effect could indicate a cross
talk between transcription and regulation of mRNA stability.

Since the translational buffering identified herein was only observed in
insulin treated cancer cells, we wondered whether this is only specific
to this system. Cellular plasticity in cancer allows cancer cells to
obtain stem cell like features (Jewer et al., 2020; Quail, Taylor, \&
Postovit, 2012; Wahl \& Spike, 2017). Therefore, we reasoned that a
system were we study gene expression of stem cells could give some
insight whether cancer cells obtained stem cell features that normal
epithelial cells do not have. Furthermore, we wanted to investigate
whether other means of mTOR inactivation, e.g.~hypoxia, would lead to
similar effects on gene expression. To assess these aspects we cultured
H9 stem cells in medium with insulin present in normoxia and hypoxia.
This experimental setup differs to that of MCF7 and HMEC cells as these
were serum starved (i.e.~no insulin in medium) prior to induction with
insulin.

Studying this system in H9 we could observe changes for all three modes
for regulation of gene expression. Most notably, we observed a large
fraction of translationally buffered mRNAs with similar 3' UTR
characteristics to that of the uncoupled subset in MCF7 cells. Using
publicly available data on mRNA stability we saw that the
translationally buffered mRNA were overall more stable as compared to
their background. Furthermore, visualising the reversed and uncoupled
subset identified in MCF7 in the H9 data we observe differences in their
regulation of total mRNA levels, indicating that these subset underlie
different modes of regulation even across these two models. Furthermore,
these data argue for that translational buffering observed in insulin
treated MCF7 cells during mTOR inhibition is not limited to that system
but can also occur under more physiological conditions.

Here we present an unprecedented and comprehensive investigation of the
effects on insulin on gene expression in cancer cells and non-
transformed epithelial cells across multiple steps of the gene
expression pathway. Our results indicate that cancer cells have acquired
an increased sensitivity to insulin signalling as compared to
non-transformed epithelial cells that is largely dependent on mTOR in
both cell types. Furthermore, we observed that cancer cells have the
ability to translationally buffer mRNAs which is a feature they share
with stem cells.

\chapter{Conclusions}

Cancer is a vastly heterogeneous disease that is characterised by
uncontrollable growth and proliferation as well as dysregulated
metabolism that can evade therapy through acquiring resistance. mRNA
translation is a common denominator of these processes and it is
therefore paramount to understand the precise mechanisms by which mRNA
translation is regulated to better formulate therapeutic strategies
against cancer.

This thesis provides an advance in methodology to analyse
transcriptome-wide changes translation efficiencies that can be applied
to study cancer models. Using this methodology in the context of
pancreatic cancer we could propose a possible new therapeutic strategy
for this lethal disease where treatment options are limited. Lastly, we
explore the effects of insulin on gene expression in an unprecedented
study that highlighted an adapted insulin responsiveness of cancer
cells. Furthermore, we illuminate the ability of cancer cells to
translationally buffer genes which is a feature they share with stem
cells and could therefore be an acquired mechanism.

Taken together this thesis provides insight on gene expression in two
different cancer models that could potentially lead to clinical
applications. While these studies are a step forward, more research is
needed to grasp the full extent of the mechanisms involved in cancer.
