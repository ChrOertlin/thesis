\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Cancer}

According to data from the World Cancer Research Fund, in 2018 there were an estimated 18 million cancer cases worldwide of which 9.5 in men and 8.5 in women. Lung and breast were the most common cancers overall. However, the most common cancers among women were breast, colorectal and lung whereas for men these were lung, prostate and colorectal cancer.

Cancer is a disease in which cells start growing abnormally and evade mechanisms monitoring cellular integrity. Hanahan et al. [@Hanahan2011] summarised such mechanisms and how cancer evades them as the hallmarks of cancer. These hallmarks will be discussed in section xxx. 

In this thesis I will discuss two studies in which breast cancer and pancreatic cancer play a central role. Therefore in the next two sections will focus on these two very different cancers.

\section{Central dogma of gene expression}


\section{mRNA translation}

For the vast majority of protein coding mRNAs,eukaryotic mRNA translation occurs in the cytoplasm, however a small subset of mRNAs is translated in the mitochondria. mRNA translation is a process that includes initiation, elongation, termination and ribosome recycling and is an essential process. mRNA translation inititiation is commonly regarded as the rate limiting step. Nevertheless, regulation of mRNA translation is also regulated at the elongation and termination phases to a lesser extent.

\subsection{mRNA translation initiation}

In eukaryotes most mRNAs are translated by scanning the mRNA for a start codon (AUG). This mechanism begins with the formation of the 43s pre-initiation complex (PIC) consisting of methionyl-initiator tRNA (met-tRNAi) in a ternary complex (TC)  with  guanosine  triphosphate  (GTP) bound eukaryotic  initiation  factor  2  (eIF2).  The  PIC is  recruited  to the 5'-cap  of mRNAs which is facilitatedby the eIF4F 5'-cap binding complex, a complex consisting of eIF4E (cap binding protein), eIF4A (RNA helicase) and eIF4G (scaffolding protein). The PIC then scans along the mRNA from the 5' end until it encounters an AUG  codon.  After AUG recognition  eIF2-GTP  is  hydrolyzed  forming  a  stable  48S  PIC.  Afterrelease  of  eIF2-GTP  the  60S ribosomal  subunit  joins  to  form  the  80S  ribosome  and  protein  synthesis  can  commence[@Hinnebusch2014,@Dever2012].  Next  to  this  scanning mechanism, mRNA translation can also be initiated via alternative cap independent mechanisms[@Wurth2015].

\subsection{mRNA translation elongation}

The 80S ribosome contains three sites; the acceptor (A), peptidyl (P) and Exit (E) sites. After initiation, the 80S ribosome is positioned  with  the  met-tRNAi  in  the  P  site  at  the  AUG  codon  with  the  following  codon  of  the  transcript  in  the  A  site awaiting its cognate tRNA. The tRNA arrives in a TC together with eukaryotic elongation factor 1A(eEF1A)at the A-site of the  ribosome.  After  arrival  in  the  A-site,the  codon  is  then  recognized.  The  binding  of  eEF1A  is  GTP  dependent, recognition  of  the  cognate  codon  by  the  tRNA  triggers  hydrolysis  whereby eEF1A  releases  from  the tRNA  thatis  then recycled by eEF1B.Peptide bonds are then formed accompanied by a tRNA hybrid state whereby acceptor sites of tRNAs in the A-and P-site now move to the P-and E-site. Binding of eEF2-GTP then promotes translocation of the tRNAs into the P-and E-sites after which eEF2B-GDP releases. After release of the deacylated tRNA from the E-site the ribosome is ready for the next cycle. This process is repeated until a stop codon (UAA,UGA or UAG)is detected by the ribosome[@Dever2012].
mRNA translation termination
Termination  of  mRNA  translation  is  facilitated  by  two  release  factors, eRF2  and  eRF3-GTP.  The  TC  with  eRF2  and  eRF3-GTP binds to the A-site of the ribosome. Recognition of the stop codon by the ribosome then causes hydrolysis resulting in a conformational change and release of the polypeptide. eRF1 and the ATP binding cassette protein (ABCE1) together promote  the  splitting  of  the  60S  and  40S  subunits,  of  which  the  40S  subunits  has  still  bound  tRNA.  After  release  of  the tRNA from the 40S subunits the parts of the translational machinery can be recycled[@Dever2012].

\section{Regulation of mRNA translation}

\subsection{mTOR singalling pathway}
mTOR  is  a  conserved  Ser/Thr  kinase  and  is  found  in  two  structurally  and  functionally  distinct  complexes,  mTORC1  and mTORC2. mTORC1 contains mTOR, regulatory associated protein of TOR (raptor), the GTPase beta-subunit like protein (GbetaL) and  disheveled,  EGL-10,  pleckstrin  [DEP]  domain  containing  mTOR-interacting  protein  (deptor).  mLST8  and  deptor  are found  in  both  mTORC1  and  mTORC2.However,  rapamycin-insensitive  companion  of  TOR  (rictor),  mammalian  stress-activated  protein  kinase  [SAPK]-interacting  protein  (mSIN1),  and  proline-rich  protein  5  (protor)  are  specific  to  mTORC2[@Saxtpn2017,@Pearce2007].  In  regards  to  regulation  of  mRNA  translation,  mTORC1  is  a  key  player  in  regulation  of  translation  initiation through  facilitating  the  release  of  eIF4E  from  4E-BPsvia  phosphorylation  of  4E-BPs  by  mTOR [@Hsieh2010].  Furthermore, substrates of mTORC1 include ribosomal S6 kinases (S6Ks) 1 and 2[@Schepetilnikov2013], and La ribonucleoprotein domain family member 1 (LARP1)[@Tcherkezian2014]. mTORC2 is found to associate with ribosomes to promote co-translational phosphorylation and foldingofnascent Aktpolypeptide[@Oh2010].As  mentioned  mTORC1  is  activated  via  growth hormonesincludinginsulin  and  insulin  like  growth  factor  (IGF).For example,wheninsulin  binds  to  the  insulin  receptor,tyrosine  kinases  (RTKs)  and  phosphoinositide  3-kinase  (PI3K)  are activated.  Phosphatidylinositol  3,4,5-triphosphate  (PIP3)  is  then  generated  by  PI3K  from  Phosphatidylinositol  4,5-biphoasphate  (PIP2).  This  step  is  reversed  by  PTEN  which  hydrolyzes  PIP3  to  PIP2,  thereby  working  antagonistically  to PI3K.  PIP3  recruits  AKT  and  phosphoinositide-dependent  kinase1  (PDK1)  towards  the  plasma  membrane  where  AKT  is phosphorylated  by  PDK1.  Ras  homologue  enriched  in  brain  (Rheb)  is  a  GTPase  that  stimulates  mTOR  in  its  GTP  bound form.  The  tuberous  sclerosis  complex  (TSC)  consists  of  TSC1  (scaffold  protein)  and  TSC2  is  a  GTPase-activating  protein (GAP) which inhibits Rheb through hydrolysis of Rheb-GTP to  Rheb-GDP, thereby inhibiting  mTOR activity. AKT mediates phosphorylation  of  TSC2,  leading  to  a  decreased  GAP  activity  and  reduced  mTOR  inhibition.  Signaling  through  the  Ras GTPase  by  growth  factors  may also  activate  mTORC1  through  the  RAF/MEK/ERK  axis  whereby  extracellular  signal-regulated kinase (ERK) leads to direct phosphorylation of TSC2 and raptor or via the RSKs[@Roux2018,@Roux2012,@Laplante2012].Protein synthesis is the most energy expensive process within cells[@Buttgereit1995].Therefore,regulation of mRNA translation is tied to cellular energy levels. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a kinase activated by increased AMP/ATPratioas well as ADP/ATP  ratios.  AMPK  inhibits  protein  synthesis  by  activation  of  TSC2,  thereby  reducing  mTOR  activity.  Furthermore, cellular  oxygen  levels  are  linked  to  ATP  production,  where  low  oxygen  levels  reduce  ATP  production  leading  to  AMPK activation[@Leibovitch2018].mTOR modulates global mRNA translation mainly throughmodulation of 4E-BPs and S6Ks[@Fonseca2014,@Hay2004].
However,mTOR also mediates  selectivemRNA  translation [@Gandin2016a]. Upon  activation, mTORphosphorylates  4E-BPsleading  to  release  of  eIF4E[@Roux2018,@Saxton2017]. As described above eIF4E then facilitates assembly of eIF4F, whichis essential  for cap dependent mRNA translation initiation.  S6Ks (S6K1 and S6K2) phosphorylates multiple componentof the translational machinery such as RPS6which is implicated  in  ribosome  biogenesis[@Magnuson2012]. Furthermore,  S6Ks  also  phosphorylateeEF2  kinase which  is a  negative  regulator of  protein  synthesis[@Wang2001].Lastly,  S6Ks  phosphorylate  programmed  cell  death  4  (PDCD4)triggering  its  SCFbetaTrCP-dependent 
degradation [@Carayol2008].PDCD4is a factor blocking the eIF4A-eIF4G interactionby binding to eIF4A.Binding of PDCD4 to eIF4A leads to  inhibitionof  eIF4A  activity  and thus translation of mRNAsthat  require  RNA  helicase  activity[@Yang2003]. More  recent work indicates an effect of mTORC1on LA motif (LAM)-containing factor family La-related protein 1 (LARP1). In that study theconserved RNA-binding protein of LARP1interacts with raptor and is phosphorylated by mTORC1.However, the scope of LARP1 mediated effectsremaincontroversial.It has been suggested LARP1 stabilizes or regulates translation of mRNAs with the terminal oligo pyrimidine (TOP) motif in a context dependent manner[@Tcherkezian2014,@Fonseca2015,@Deragon2015).
