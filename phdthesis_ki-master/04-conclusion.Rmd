\chapter{Conclusions}
 
 Cancer is a vastly heterogenous disease that is characterised by uncontrollable growth and proliferation as well as dysregulated metabolism that can evade therapy through acquiring resistance. mRNA translation is a common denominator of these processes and it is therefore paramount to understand the precise mechanisms by which mRNA transaltion is regulated to better formulate therapeutic strategies against cancer. 
 
This thesis provides an advance in methodology that facilitates transcriptome-wide analysis of translation efficiencies that can be applied to study cancer models and how they adapt to evade therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, by applying this methodology
