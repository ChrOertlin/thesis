  abstract = {Eukaryotic cells rapidly reduce protein synthesis in response to various stress conditions. This can be achieved by the phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of a key translation initiation factor, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2). However, the persistent translation of certain mRNAs is required for deployment of an adequate stress response. We carried out ribosome profiling of cultured human cells under conditions of severe stress induced with sodium arsenite. Although this led to a 5.4-fold general translational repression, the protein coding open reading frames (ORFs) of certain individual mRNAs exhibited resistance to the inhibition. Nearly all resistant transcripts possess at least one efficiently translated upstream open reading frame (uORF) that represses translation of the main coding ORF under normal conditions. Site-specific mutagenesis of two identified stress resistant mRNAs (PPP1R15B and IFRD1) demonstrated that a single uORF is sufficient for eIF2-mediated translation control in both cases. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that at least two regulatory uORFs (namely, in SLC35A4 and MIEF1) encode functional protein products.},

  abstract = {Despite the greater functional importance of protein levels, our knowledge of gene expression evolution is based almost entirely on studies of mRNA levels. In contrast, our understanding of how translational regulation evolves has lagged far behind. Here we have applied ribosome profiling--which measures both global mRNA levels and their translation rates--to two species of Saccharomyces yeast and their interspecific hybrid in order to assess the relative contributions of changes in mRNA abundance and translation to regulatory evolution. We report that both cis- and trans-acting regulatory divergence in translation are abundant, affecting at least 35\% of genes. The majority of translational divergence acts to buffer changes in mRNA abundance, suggesting a widespread role for stabilizing selection acting across regulatory levels. Nevertheless, we observe evidence of lineage-specific selection acting on several yeast functional modules, including instances of reinforcing selection acting at both levels of regulation. Finally, we also uncover multiple instances of stop-codon readthrough that are conserved between species. Our analysis reveals the underappreciated complexity of post-transcriptional regulatory divergence and indicates that partitioning the search for the locus of selection into the binary categories of "coding" versus "regulatory" may overlook a significant source of selection, acting at multiple regulatory levels along the path from genotype to phenotype.},

We report the cloning and characterization of human cDNAs encoding two of its subunits, p110 and p36. It was found that the second slowest band during polyacrylamide gel electrophresis of eIF3 subunits in sodium dodecyl sulfate contains two proteins: p110 and p116. Analysis of the cloned cDNA encoding p110 indicates that its amino acid sequence is 31\% identical to that of the yeast protein, Nip1. The p116 cDNA was cloned and characterized as a human homolog of yeast Prt1, as described elsewhere (M\'ethot, N., Rom, E., Olsen, H., and Sonenberg, N. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 1110-1116). p36 is a WD40 repeat protein, which is 46\% identical to the p39 subunit of yeast eIF3 and is identical to TRIP-1, a phosphorylation substrate of the TGF-{$\beta$} type II receptor. The p116, p110, and p36 subunits localize on 40 S ribosomes in cells active in translation and co-immunoprecipitate with affinity-purified antibodies against the p170 subunit, showing that these proteins are integral components of eIF3. Although p36 and p116 have homologous protein subunits in yeast eIF3, the p110 homolog, Nip1, is not detected in yeast eIF3 preparations. The results indicate both conservation and diversity in eIF3 between yeast and humans.},

The eIF5 stimulates GTP hydrolysis by the eIF2/GTP/Met-tRNAi Met ternary complex on base-pairing between Met-tRNAi Met and the start codon. The eIF2, eIF5, and eIF1 all have been implicated in stringent selection of AUG as the start codon. The eIF3 binds to the 40S ribosome and promotes recruitment of the ternary complex; however, physical contact between eIF3 and eIF2 has not been observed. We show that yeast eIF5 can bridge interaction in vitro between eIF3 and eIF2 by binding simultaneously to the amino terminus of eIF3 subunit NIP1 and the amino-terminal half of eIF2{$\beta$}, dependent on a conserved bipartite motif in the carboxyl terminus of eIF5. Additionally, the amino terminus of NIP1 can bind concurrently to eIF5 and eIF1. These findings suggest the occurrence of an eIF3/eIF1/eIF5/eIF2 multifactor complex, which was observed in cell extracts free of 40S ribosomes and found to contain stoichiometric amounts of tRNAi Met. The multifactor complex was disrupted by the tif5-7A mutation in the bipartite motif of eIF5. Importantly, the tif5-7A mutant is temperature sensitive and displayed a substantial reduction in translation initiation at the restrictive temperature. We propose that the multifactor complex is an important intermediate in translation initiation in vivo.},

In the present study we show that elongation factor 2 (EF2) mRNA is translationally regulated in a growth-dependent manner in cells of hematopoietic origin, but not in any of three different non-hematopoietic cell lines studied. Human {$\beta$}1-tubulin mRNA is a new member of the family which contains all the hallmarks of a typical TOP mRNA, yet its translation is refractory to growth arrest of any of the examined cell lines. Transfection experiments indicate that the first 29 and 53 nucleotides of the mRNAs encoding EF2 and {$\beta$}1-tubulin, respectively, contain all the translational cis -regulatory elements sufficient for ubiquitously conferring growth-dependent translational control on a reporter mRNA. These results suggest that the distinct translational regulation of TOP mRNAs reflects downstream sequences which can override the regulatory features of the 5{${'}$} TOP in a cell type-specific manner. This notion is further supported by the fact that mutations within the region immediately downstream of the 5{${'}$} TOP of rpS16 mRNA confer onto the resulting transcripts growth-dependent translational control with a cell type specificity similar to that displayed by EF2 mRNA.},

  abstract = {Purpose Activating mutations in the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathway are present in the majority of breast cancers and therefore are a major focus of drug development and clinical trials. Pathway mutations have been proposed as predictive biomarkers for efficacy of PI3K-targeted therapies. However, the precise contribution of distinct PI3K pathway mutations to drug sensitivity is unknown. Experimental Design We describe the creation of a physiologic human luminal breast cancer cell line model to study the phenotype of these mutations using the MCF-7 cell line. We utilized somatic cell gene targeting to ``correct'' PIK3CA E545K mutant alleles in MCF-7 cells to wild type sequence. The AKT1 E17K hotspot mutation was knocked in on this wild type background. Results Loss of mutant PIK3CA dramatically reduced phosphorylation of AKT proteins and several known AKT targets, but other AKT target proteins and downstream effectors of mTOR were not affected. PIK3CA wild type cells exhibited reduced proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Knock-in of the AKT1 E17K hotspot mutation on this PIK3CA wild type background restored pathway signaling, proliferation, and tumor growth in vivo. PIK3CA, but not AKT1 mutation, increased sensitivity to the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 and the allosteric AKT inhibitor MK-2206. Conclusions AKT1 E17K is a bona fide oncogene in a human luminal breast cancer context. Distinct PI3K pathway mutations confer differential sensitivity to drugs targeting the pathway at different points and by distinct mechanisms. These findings have implications for the use of tumor genome sequencing to assign patients to targeted therapies.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Angiomyolipomas in patients with the tuberous sclerosis complex or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis are associated with mutations in tuberous sclerosis genes resulting in constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The drug sirolimus suppresses mTOR signaling. METHODS: We conducted a 24-month, nonrandomized, open-label trial to determine whether sirolimus reduces the angiomyolipoma volume in patients with the tuberous sclerosis complex or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Sirolimus was administered for the first 12 months only. Serial magnetic resonance imaging of angiomyolipomas and brain lesions, computed tomography of lung cysts, and pulmonary-function tests were performed. RESULTS: Of the 25 patients enrolled, 20 completed the 12-month evaluation, and 18 completed the 24-month evaluation. The mean (+/-SD) angiomyolipoma volume at 12 months was 53.2+/-26.6\% of the baseline value (P{$<$}0.001) and at 24 months was 85.9+/-28.5\% of the baseline value (P=0.005). At 24 months, five patients had a persistent reduction in the angiomyolipoma volume of 30\% or more. During the period of sirolimus therapy, among patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis, the mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) increased by 118+/-330 ml (P=0.06), the forced vital capacity (FVC) increased by 390+/-570 ml (P{$<$}0.001), and the residual volume decreased by 439+/-493 ml (P=0.02), as compared with baseline values. One year after sirolimus was discontinued, the FEV1 was 62+/-411 ml above the baseline value, the FVC was 346+/-712 ml above the baseline value, and the residual volume was 333+/-570 ml below the baseline value; cerebral lesions were unchanged. Five patients had six serious adverse events while receiving sirolimus, including diarrhea, pyelonephritis, stomatitis, and respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS: Angiomyolipomas regressed somewhat during sirolimus therapy but tended to increase in volume after the therapy was stopped. Some patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis had improvement in spirometric measurements and gas trapping that persisted after treatment. Suppression of mTOR signaling might constitute an ameliorative treatment in patients with the tuberous sclerosis complex or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

Mitochondrial proton leak was the least sensitive to energy supply. Control analysis was used to quantify the relative control over ATP production exerted by the individual groups of ATP-consuming reactions. Control was widely shared; no block of reactions had more than one-third of the control. A fuller control analysis showed that there appeared to be a hierarchy of control over the flux through ATP: protein synthesis \textbackslash textgreater RNA/DNA synthesis and substrate oxidation \textbackslash textgreater Na+ cycling and Ca2+ cycling \textbackslash textgreater other ATP consumers and mitochondrial proton leak.

We have previously shown that the mTOR/p70 S6 kinase (p70 S6K) pathway is constitutively activated in BCR-ABL transformed cells and that inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity by imatinib mesylate abrogates such activation. We now provide evidence for the existence of a novel regulatory mechanism by which BCR-ABL promotes cell proliferation, involving p70 S6K-mediated suppression of expression of programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), a tumor suppressor protein that acts as an inhibitor of cap-dependent translation by blocking the translation initiation factor eIF4A. Our data also establish that second generation BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors block activation of p70 S6K and downstream engagement of the S6 ribosomal protein in BCR-ABL transformed cells. Moreover, PDCD4 protein expression is up-regulated by inhibition of the BCR-ABL kinase in K562 cells and BaF3/BCR-ABL transfectants, suggesting a mechanism for the generation of the proapoptotic effects of such inhibitors. Knockdown of PDCD4 expression results in reversal of the suppressive effects of nilotinib and imatinib mesylate on leukemic progenitor colony formation, suggesting an important role for this protein in the generation of antileukemic responses. Altogether, our studies identify a novel mechanism by which BCR-ABL may promote leukemic cell growth, involving sequential engagement of the mTOR/p70 S6K pathway and downstream suppression of PDCD4 expression.},

  abstract = {The eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4G functions as a scaffold protein that assembles components of the translation initiation complex required to recruit the 40S ribosomal subunit to an mRNA. Although many eukaryotes express two highly similar eIF4G isoforms, those in plants are highly divergent in size and sequence from one another and are referred to as eIF4G and eIFiso4G. Although the domain organization of eIFiso4G differs substantially from eIF4G orthologs in other species, the domain organization of plant eIF4G is largely unknown despite the fact that it is more similar in size and sequence to eIF4G of other eukaryotes. In this study, we show that eIF4G differs from eIFiso4G in that it contains two distinct interaction domains for the poly(A) binding protein (PABP) and eIF4B but is similar to eIFiso4G in having two eIF4A interaction domains. PABP and eIF4B bind the same N-terminal region of eIF4G as they do to a region C-proximal to the HEAT-1 domain in the middle domain of eIF4G, resulting in competitive binding between eIF4B and PABP to each site. eIF4G also differs from eIFiso4G in that no competitive binding was observed between PABP and eIF4A or between eIF4B and eIF4A to its HEAT-1-containing region. These results demonstrate that despite substantial differences in size, sequence, and domain organization, PABP and eIF4B bind to eIF4G and eIFiso4G competitively.},

With the integration of matched RNA sequencing data, the translation efficiency (TE) of genes can be calculated to reveal translational regulation. This layer of gene-expression regulation is otherwise difficult to assess on a global scale and generally not well understood in the context of human disease. Current statistical methods to calculate differences in TE have low accuracy, cannot accommodate complex experimental designs or confounding factors, and do not categorize genes into buffered, intensified, or exclusively translationally regulated genes. This article outlines a method [referred to as deltaTE ({$\Delta$}TE), standing for change in TE] to identify translationally regulated genes, which addresses the shortcomings of previous methods. In an extensive benchmarking analysis, {$\Delta$}TE outperforms all methods tested. Furthermore, applying {$\Delta$}TE on data from human primary cells allows detection of substantially more translationally regulated genes, providing a clearer understanding of translational regulation in pathogenic processes. In this article, we describe protocols for data preparation, normalization, analysis, and visualization, starting from raw sequencing files. \textcopyright{} 2019 The Authors.

FMRP is a polyribosome-associated neuronal RNA-binding protein, suggesting that it plays a key role in regulating neuronal translation, but there has been little consensus regarding either its RNA targets or mechanism of action. Here, we use high-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) to identify FMRP interactions with mouse brain polyribosomal mRNAs. FMRP interacts with the coding region of transcripts encoding pre- and postsynaptic proteins and transcripts implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We developed a brain polyribosome-programmed translation system, revealing that FMRP reversibly stalls ribosomes specifically on its target mRNAs. Our results suggest that loss of a translational brake on the synthesis of a subset of synaptic proteins contributes to FXS. In addition, they provide insight into the molecular basis of the cognitive and allied defects in FXS and ASD and suggest multiple targets for clinical intervention. PaperClip},

However, inactivation of eIF4E does not impair translation of many capped mRNAs, suggesting an unknown alternate mechanism may exist for cap-dependent but eIF4E-independent translation. We show that DAP5, an eIF4GI homolog that lacks eIF4E binding, utilizes eIF3d to facilitate cap-dependent translation of approximately 20\% of mRNAs. Genome-wide transcriptomic and translatomic analyses indicate that DAP5 is required for translation of many transcription factors and receptor capped mRNAs and their mRNA targets involved in cell survival, motility, DNA repair and translation initiation, among other mRNAs. Mass spectrometry and crosslinking studies demonstrate that eIF3d is a direct binding partner of DAP5. In vitro translation and ribosome complex studies demonstrate that DAP5 and eIF3d are both essential for eIF4E-independent capped-mRNA translation. These studies disclose a widespread and previously unknown mechanism for cap-dependent mRNA translation by DAP5-eIF3d complexes.},

Members of the LARP1 family are found in most protists, fungi, plants, and animals. We review here evidence suggesting that LARP1 are key versatile messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding proteins involved in regulating important biological processes such as gametogenesis, embryogenesis, sex determination, and cell division in animals, as well as acclimation to stress in yeasts and plants. LARP1 proteins perform all these essential tasks likely by binding to key mRNAs and regulating their stability and/or translation. In human, the impact of LARP1 over cell division and proliferation is potentially under the control of the TORC1 complex. We review data suggesting that LARP1 is a direct target of this master signaling hub. TOR-dependent LARP1 phosphorylation could specifically enhance the translation of TOP mRNAs providing a way to promote translation, growth, and proliferation. Consequently, LARP1 is found to be significantly upregulated in many malignant cell types. In plants, LARP1 was found to act as a cofactor of the heat-induced mRNA degradation process, an essential acclimation strategy leading to the degradation of more than 4500 mRNAs coding for growth and development housekeeping functions. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the LARP1 proteins (Slf1p and Sro9p) are important, among other things, for copper resistance and oxidative stress survival. LARP1 proteins are therefore emerging as critical ancient mRNA-binding factors that evolved common as well as specific targets and regulatory functions in all eukaryotic lineages.},

Here, we quantified PTR ratios for 11,575 proteins across 29 human tissues using matched transcriptomes and proteomes. We estimated by regression the contribution of known sequence determinants of protein synthesis and degradation in addition to 45 mRNA and 3 protein sequence motifs that we found by association testing. While PTR ratios span more than 2 orders of magnitude, our integrative model predicts PTR ratios at a median precision of 3.2-fold. A reporter assay provided functional support for two novel UTR motifs, and an immobilized mRNA affinity competition-binding assay identified motif-specific bound proteins for one motif. Moreover, our integrative model led to a new metric of codon optimality that captures the effects of codon frequency on protein synthesis and degradation. Altogether, this study shows that a large fraction of PTR ratio variation in human tissues can be predicted from sequence, and it identifies many new candidate post-transcriptional regulatory elements.},

  abstract = {Control of translation allows for the production of stoichiometric levels of each protein in the cell. Attaining such a level of fine-tuned regulation of protein production requires the coordinated temporal and spatial control of numerous cellular signalling cascades impinging on the various components of the translational machinery. Foremost among these is the mTOR signalling pathway. The mTOR pathway regulates both the initiation and elongation steps of protein synthesis through the phosphorylation of numerous translation factors, while simultaneously ensuring adequate folding of nascent polypeptides through co-translational degradation of misfolded proteins. Perhaps most remarkably, mTOR is also a key regulator of the synthesis of ribosomal proteins and translation factors themselves. Two seminal studies have recently shown in translatome analysis that the mTOR pathway preferentially regulates the translation of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and translation factors. Therefore, the role of the mTOR pathway in the control of protein synthesis extends far beyond immediate translational control. By controlling ribosome production (and ultimately ribosome availability), mTOR is a master long-term controller of protein synthesis. Herein, we review the literature spanning the early discoveries of mTOR on translation to the latest advances in our understanding of how the mTOR pathway controls the synthesis of ribosomal proteins.},

The best studied targets of mTORC1 in translation are the eukaryotic initiation factor-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). In this study, we identify the La-related protein 1 (LARP1) as a key novel target of mTORC1 with a fundamental role in terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNA translation. Recent genome-wide studies indicate that TOP and TOP-like mRNAs compose a large portion of the mTORC1 translatome, but the mechanism by which mTORC1 controls TOP mRNA translation is incompletely understood. Here, we report that LARP1 functions as a key repressor of TOP mRNA translation downstream of mTORC1. Our data show the following: (i) LARP1 associates with mTORC1 via RAPTOR; (ii) LARP1 interacts with TOP mRNAs in an mTORC1-dependent manner; (iii) LARP1 binds the 5'TOP motif to repress TOP mRNA translation; and (iv) LARP1 competes with the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4G for TOP mRNA binding. Importantly, from a drug resistance standpoint, our data also show that reducing LARP1 protein levels by RNA interference attenuates the inhibitory effect of rapamycin, Torin1, and amino acid deprivation on TOP mRNA translation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that LARP1 functions as an important repressor of TOP mRNA translation downstream of mTORC1.},

Accordingly, dysregulation of mRNA translation is considered to play a major role in a variety of pathological states including cancer. Ribosomes also host chaperones, which facilitate folding of nascent polypeptides, thereby modulating function and stability of newly synthesized polypeptides. In addition, emerging data indicate that ribosomes serve as a platform for a repertoire of signaling molecules, which are implicated in a variety of post-translational modifications of newly synthesized polypeptides as they emerge from the ribosome, and/or components of translational machinery. Herein, a well-established method of ribosome fractionation using sucrose density gradient centrifugation is described. In conjunction with the in-house developed "anota" algorithm this method allows direct determination of differential translation of individual mRNAs on a genome-wide scale.

We show that mTOR suppresses translation of mRNAs activated under short-term stress wherein TC recycling is attenuated by eIF2{$\alpha$} phosphorylation. During acute nutrient or growth factor stimulation, mTORC1 induces eIF2{$\beta$} phosphorylation and recruitment of NCK1 to eIF2, decreases eIF2{$\alpha$} phosphorylation and bolsters TC recycling. Accordingly, eIF2{$\beta$} mediates the effect of mTORC1 on protein synthesis and proliferation. In addition, we demonstrate a formerly undocumented role for CK2 in regulation of translation initiation, whereby CK2 stimulates phosphorylation of eIF2{$\beta$} and simultaneously bolsters eIF4F complex assembly via the mTORC1/4E-BP pathway. These findings imply a previously unrecognized mode of translation regulation, whereby mTORC1 and CK2 coordinate TC and eIF4F complex assembly to stimulate cell proliferation. Ternary complex (TC) and eIF4F complex assembly are rate-limiting steps in translation initiation that are regulated by eIF2{$\alpha$} phosphorylation and the mTOR/4E-BP pathway.

Whereas ribosome-profiling suggested that MTOR almost exclusively stimulates translation of the TOP (terminal oligopyrimidine motif) and TOP-like mRNAs, polysome-profiling indicated that MTOR also modulates translation of mRNAs without the 5' TOP motif (non-TOP mRNAs). We demonstrate that in ribosome-profiling studies, detection of MTOR-dependent changes in non-TOP mRNA translation was obscured by low sensitivity and methodology biases. Transcription start site profiling using nano-cap analysis of gene expression (nanoCAGE) revealed that not only do many MTOR-sensitive mRNAs lack the 5' TOP motif but that 5' UTR features distinguish two functionally and translationally distinct subsets of MTOR-sensitive mRNAs: (1) mRNAs with short 5' UTRs enriched for mitochondrial functions, which require EIF4E but are less EIF4A1-sensitive; and (2) long 5' UTR mRNAs encoding proliferation- and survival-promoting proteins, which are both EIF4E- and EIF4A1-sensitive. Selective inhibition of translation of mRNAs harboring long 5' UTRs via EIF4A1 suppression leads to sustained expression of proteins involved in respiration but concomitant loss of those protecting mitochondrial structural integrity, resulting in apoptosis. Conversely, simultaneous suppression of translation of both long and short 5' UTR mRNAs by MTOR inhibitors results in metabolic dormancy and a predominantly cytostatic effect. Thus, 5' UTR features define different modes of MTOR-sensitive translation of functionally distinct subsets of mRNAs, which may explain the diverse impact of MTOR and EIF4A inhibitors on neoplastic cells.},

By immunohistochemical analyses of 148 tissues from 89 prostate cancer patients, we now show that both eIF4E expression and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (p4E-BP1) are increased significantly, particularly in advanced prostate cancer versus benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues. Further, increased eIF4E and p4E-BP1 levels are significantly related to reduced patient survival, whereas uniform 4E-BP1 expression is significantly related to better patient survival. Both immunohistochemistry and Western blotting reveal that elevated eIF4E and p4E-BP1 are evident in the same prostate cancer tissues. In two distinct prostate cancer cell models, the progression to androgen independence also involves increased eIF4E activation. In these prostate cancer cells, reducing eIF4E expression with an eIF4E-specific antisense oligonucleotide currently in phase I clinical trials robustly induces apoptosis, regardless of cell cycle phase, and reduces expression of the eIF4E-regulated proteins BCL-2 and c-myc. Collectively, these data implicate eIF4E activation in prostate cancer and suggest that targeting eIF4E may be attractive for prostate cancer therapy.},

Chem. 256, 791-794), eIF-4F includes the 24,000-dalton cap binding protein and major polypeptides of Mr approximately 200,000 and approximately 46,000. The latter component comigrates with eIF-4A by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and, like eIF-4A, chemically cross-links to the 5'-end of capped mRNA by an ATP-dependent, m7GDP-sensitive reaction. Unlike eIF-4F, cap binding protein of Mr approximately 24,000 isolated by affinity chromatography on m7GDP-Sepharose does not stimulate globin synthesis in the reconstituted system.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Integrated Stress Response is a homeostatic mechanism induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In acute/transient ER stress, decreased global protein synthesis and increased uORF mRNA translation are followed by normalization of protein synthesis. Here, we report a dramatically different response during chronic ER stress. This chronic ISR program is characterized by persistently elevated uORF mRNA translation and concurrent gene expression reprogramming, which permits simultaneous stress sensing and proteostasis. The program includes PERK-dependent switching to an eIF3-dependent translation initiation mechanism resulting in partial but not complete translational recovery, which, together with transcriptional reprogramming, selectively bolsters expression of proteins with ER functions. Coordination of transcriptional and translational reprogramming prevents ER dysfunction and inhibits ``foamy cell'' development, thus establishing a molecular basis for understanding human diseases associated with ER dysfunction.,  , Guan et al. unravel the mechanism of adaptation to chronic stress which encompasses previously unappreciated remodeling of the translation initiation machinery guided by PERK. These changes in the translation machinery are coordinated with stress-induced transcriptional reprograming and when disrupted result in a foamy cell phenotype and cell death.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional silencing that begins with oocyte maturation persists during the initial mitotic divisions of the embryo. Gene expression during this period largely depends on the translational activation of maternal mRNAs by cytoplasmic polyadenylation and requires an embryonic poly(A) binding protein (EPAB). EPAB has been identified in Xenopus and mouse, where it is expressed exclusively in oocytes and early embryos until zygotic genome activation (ZGA) when it is replaced by the somatic cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein (PABPC1). EPAB plays a central role in the regulation of maternal mRNA activation by preventing deadenylation and promoting translation. In this study, we identified and characterized the human EPAB ortholog. Human EPAB is a 619 amino acid protein with 77\% identity and 84\% similarity to mouse EPAB. Human EPAB mRNA is detected in ovaries, testes and several somatic tissues including pancreas, liver and thymus. Similar to the observations in Xenopus and mouse, human EPAB is the predominant poly(A) binding protein in immature (germinal vesicle) and mature (metaphase II) oocytes, and it is replaced by PABPC1 following ZGA, which occurs at 4- to 8-cell stage in human. Our findings suggest that the unique translational regulatory pathways that control gene expression during oogenesis and early embryo development may be common between model organisms and humans.},

The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list - reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer. \textcopyright{} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

The largest of these initiation factors, the eIF3 complex, organizes a web of interactions among several eIFs that assemble on the 40S subunit and participate in the different reactions involved in translation. Structural analysis suggests that eIF3 performs this scaffolding function by binding to the 40S subunit on its solvent-exposed surface rather than on its interface with the 60S subunit, where the decoding sites exist. This location of eIF3 seems ideally suited for its other proposed regulatory functions, including reinitiating translation on polycistronic mRNAs and acting as a receptor for protein kinases that control protein synthesis.},

Binding of Met-tRNAi to the small (40S) ribosomal subunit, in a ternary complex (TC) with eIF2-GTP, is stimulated by eukaryotic initiation factor 1 (eIF1), eIF1A, eIF3, and eIF5, and the resulting preinitiation complex (PIC) joins the 5' end of mRNA preactivated by eIF4F and poly(A)-binding protein. RNA helicases remove secondary structures that impede ribosome attachment and subsequent scanning. Hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP is stimulated by eIF5 in the scanning PIC, but completion of the reaction is impeded at non-AUG triplets. Although eIF1 and eIF1A promote scanning, eIF1 and possibly the C-terminal tail of eIF1A must be displaced from the P decoding site to permit base-pairing between Met-tRNAi and the AUG codon, as well as to allow subsequent phosphate release from eIF2-GDP. A second GTPase, eIF5B, catalyzes the joining of the 60S subunit to produce an 80S initiation complex that is competent for elongation.},

While phosphorylation of rpS6 is dispensable for cancer formation, 4EBP-eIF4E exerts significant control over cap-dependent translation, cell growth, cancer initiation, and progression. This effect is mediated at least in part through 4EBP-dependent control of Mcl-1 expression, a key antiapoptotic protein. By using an active site inhibitor of mTOR, PP242, we show a marked therapeutic response in rapamycin-resistant tumors. The therapeutic benefit of PP242 is mediated through inhibition of mTORC1-dependent 4EBP-eIF4E hyperactivation. Thus, the 4EBP-eIF4E axis downstream of mTOR is a druggable mediator of translational control and Akt-mediated tumorigenesis that has important implications for the treatment of human cancers.},

PABP is able to bind the poly(A) tail of mRNA, as well as translation initiation factor 4G and eukaryotic release factor 3a (eRF3a). PABP has been found to stimulate translation initiation and to inhibit nonsense-mediated mRNA decay. Using a reconstituted mammalian in vitro translation system, we show that PABP directly stimulates translation termination. PABP increases the efficiency of translation termination by recruitment of eRF3a and eRF1 to the ribosome. PABP's function in translation termination depends on its C-terminal domain and its interaction with the N-terminus of eRF3a. Interestingly, we discover that full-length eRF3a exerts a different mode of function compared to its truncated form eRF3c, which lacks the N-terminal domain. Pre-association of eRF3a, but not of eRF3c, with pre-termination complexes (preTCs) significantly increases the efficiency of peptidyl\textendash tRNA hydrolysis by eRF1. This implicates new, additional interactions of full-length eRF3a with the ribosomal preTC. Based on our findings, we suggest that PABP enhances the productive binding of the eRF1\textendash eRF3 complex to the ribosome, via interactions with the N-terminal domain of eRF3a which itself has an active role in translation termination.},

Initiation complex formation on globin mRNA, or on capped viral RNAs such as papaya mosaic virus RNA and tobacco mosaic virus RNA, was strongly stimulated by ATP. In contrast, initiation complex formation on (uncapped) encephalomyocarditis virus RNA was uninfluenced by the presence or absence of ATP, which may be correlated with the recent evidence for scanning-independent internal initiation on this viral RNA. In addition, initiation complex formation on uncapped cowpea mosaic virus RNA and on poly(A,U,G) was only slightly stimulated by ATP, much less than in the case of the capped RNAs. These results suggest that most of the ATP hydrolysed during translation initiation is consumed in cap-dependent processes, probably in unwinding the mRNA, and relatively little in the actual migration or scanning of 40S subunits along the mRNA.},

It binds the m7Gppp cap moiety and the adjacent 5'TOP motif of TOP mRNAs, thus impeding the assembly of the eIF4F complex on these transcripts. mTORC1 controls TOP mRNA translation via LARP1, but the details of the mechanism are unclear. Herein we elucidate the mechanism by which mTORC1 controls LARP1's translation repression activity. We demonstrate that mTORC1 phosphorylates LARP1 in vitro and in vivo, activities that are efficiently inhibited by rapamycin and torin1. We uncover 26 rapamycin-sensitive phospho-serine and -threonine residues on LARP1 that are distributed in 7 clusters. Our data show that phosphorylation of a cluster of residues located proximally to the m7Gppp cap-binding DM15 region is particularly sensitive to rapamycin and regulates both the RNA-binding and the translation inhibitory activities of LARP1. Our results unravel a new model of translation control in which the La module (LaMod) and DM15 region of LARP1, both of which can directly interact with TOP mRNA, are differentially regulated: the LaMod remains constitutively bound to PABP (irrespective of the activation status of mTORC1), while the C-terminal DM15 'pendular hook' engages the TOP mRNA 5'-end to repress translation, but only in conditions of mTORC1 inhibition.},

  abstract = {Cell type\textendash specific quantitative trait loci Understanding how human genetic variation affects phenotype requires tissue- or even cell type\textendash specific measurements. Kim-Hellmuth et al. used computational methods to identify cell-type proportions within bulk tissues in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project dataset to identify cell-type interaction quantitative trait loci and map these to genetic variants correlated with expression or splicing differences between individuals. By characterizing the cellular context, this study illustrates how genetic variants that operate in a cell type\textendash specific manner affect gene regulation and can be linked to complex traits. This deconvolution and analysis of cell types from bulk tissues allows greater precision in understanding how phenotypes are linked to genetic variation. Science, this issue p. eaaz8528 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONEfforts to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) across human tissues by the GTEx Consortium and others have identified expression and splicing QTLs (eQTLs and sQTLs, respectively) for a majority of genes. However, these studies were largely performed with gene expression measurements from bulk tissue samples, thus obscuring the cellular specificity of genetic regulatory effects and in turn limiting their functional interpretation. Identifying the cell type (or types) in which a QTL is active will be key to uncovering the molecular mechanisms that underlie complex trait variation. Recent studies demonstrated the feasibility of identifying cell type\textendash specific QTLs from bulk tissue RNA-sequencing data by using computational estimates of cell type proportions. To date, such approaches have only been applied to a limited number of cell types and tissues. By applying this methodology to GTEx tissues for a diverse set of cell types, we aim to characterize the cellular specificity of genetic effects across human tissues and to describe the contribution of these effects to complex traits. RATIONALEA growing number of in silico cell type deconvolution methods and associated reference panels with cell type\textendash specific marker genes enable the robust estimation of the enrichment of specific cell types from bulk tissue gene expression data. We benchmarked and used enrichment estimates for seven cell types (adipocytes, epithelial cells, hepatocytes, keratinocytes, myocytes, neurons, and neutrophils) across 35 tissues from the GTEx project to map QTLs that are specific to at least one cell type. We mapped such cell type\textendash interaction QTLs for expression and splicing (ieQTLs and isQTLs, respectively) by testing for interactions between genotype and cell type enrichment. RESULTSUsing 43 pairs of tissues and cell types, we found 3347 protein-coding and long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) genes with an ieQTL and 987 genes with an isQTL (at 5\% false discovery rate in each pair). To validate these findings, we tested the QTLs for replication in available external datasets and applied an independent validation using allele-specific expression from eQTL heterozygotes. We analyzed the cell type\textendash interaction QTLs for patterns of tissue sharing and found that ieQTLs are enriched for genes with tissue-specific eQTLs and are generally not shared across unrelated tissues, suggesting that tissue-specific eQTLs originate in tissue-specific cell types. Last, we tested the ieQTLs and isQTLs for colocalization with genetic associations for 87 complex traits. We show that cell type\textendash interaction QTLs are enriched for complex trait associations and identify colocalizations for hundreds of loci that were undetected in bulk tissue, corresponding to an increase of {$>$}50\% over colocalizations with standard QTLs. Our results also reveal the cellular specificity and potential origin for a similar number of colocalized standard QTLs. CONCLUSIONThe ieQTLs and isQTLs identified for seven cell types across GTEx tissues suggest that the large majority of cell type\textendash specific QTLs remains to be discovered. Our colocalization results indicate that comprehensive mapping of cell type\textendash specific QTLs will be highly valuable for gaining a mechanistic understanding of complex trait associations. We anticipate that the approaches presented here will complement studies mapping QTLs in single cells. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/369/6509/eaaz8528/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Detection of cell type\textendash specific effects on gene expression.The enrichment of seven cell types is calculated across GTEx tissues, enabling mapping of cell type\textendash interaction QTLs for expression and splicing by testing for significant interactions between genotypes and cell type enrichments. Linking these QTLs to complex trait associations enables discovery of {$>$}50\% more colocalizations compared with standard QTLs and reveals the cellular specificity of traits. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project has identified expression and splicing quantitative trait loci in cis (QTLs) for the majority of genes across a wide range of human tissues. However, the functional characterization of these QTLs has been limited by the heterogeneous cellular composition of GTEx tissue samples. We mapped interactions between computational estimates of cell type abundance and genotype to identify cell type\textendash interaction QTLs for seven cell types and show that cell type\textendash interaction expression QTLs (eQTLs) provide finer resolution to tissue specificity than bulk tissue cis-eQTLs. Analyses of genetic associations with 87 complex traits show a contribution from cell type\textendash interaction QTLs and enables the discovery of hundreds of previously unidentified colocalized loci that are masked in bulk tissue. Cell type composition, estimated from bulk tissue, maps the cellular specificity of genetic variants.

Biochemical and genetic studies have instead revealed high levels of coupling between the different stages. In recent years, genome-wide and systems-level analyses have greatly extended our understanding of coupling in gene expression, by both revealing the effect that certain forms of coupling have on a more global scale, and unveiling novel forms of coupling that had not been identified using more traditional techniques.Genomic analyses of the binding of transcription factors and chromatin remodellers with DNA have revealed extensive coordination and coupling between these factors, forming regulatory networks that control how many genes are expressed.Genome-wide analysis of associations between the nuclear pore and nuclear lamina revealed extensive coupling between the transcription level of a given gene and its nuclear localization. In particular, different subcomplexes within the nuclear pore associate with specific types of genetic loci.Genomic analyses of mRNA processing have shown that splicing commitment occurs co-transcriptionally, but that in yeast the splicing completes post-transcriptionally, and that the spliceosome can regulate expression of specific types of mRNAs by increasing or decreasing their splicing efficiencies.Microarray analyses have also shown that the co-transcriptional recruitment of mRNA export factors results in functional specificities, in which different factors transport specific types of mRNAs; the combination of whole-genome screens and array analyses also demonstrated an important role for the exosome in mRNA export.Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray (ChIP\textendash chip) analyses in higher eukaryotes provide support for a dynamic messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) model, in which the composition of the mRNP associated with the nascent transcript changes along the length of the transcript.Whole-genome analysis of the associations between proteasomal components and chromatin revealed a widespread role for the proteasome in transcriptional activation and enrichment of binding of the proteasome at ribosomal protein genes. This coupling between the protein synthesis and degradation machineries could allow feedback that globally reduces expression levels when the proteasome is compromised.Network analysis of the genomic associations of many factors involved in gene expression revealed novel connections between the different levels of gene expression. In particular, factors involved in nuclear transport, general transcription factors, RNA-processing factors and nucleosome remodellers were found to exhibit highly similar binding profiles and to have a large number of neighbours, allowing them to exert global influences on many genes at once.},

The elongation cycle requires dramatic structural rearrangements of the ribosome. We show here that deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments reveals not only the position of each ribosome but also, unexpectedly, its particular stage of the elongation cycle. Sequencing reveals two distinct populations of ribosome footprints, 28\textendash 30 nucleotides and 20\textendash 22 nucleotides long, representing translating ribosomes in distinct states, differentially stabilized by specific elongation inhibitors. We find that the balance of small and large footprints varies by codon and is correlated with translation speed. The ability to visualize conformational changes in the ribosome during elongation, at single-codon resolution, provides a new way to study the detailed kinetics of translation and a new probe with which to identify the factors that affect each step in the elongation cycle.},

  abstract = {Regulation of gene expression through translational control is a fundamental mechanism implicated in many biological processes ranging from memory formation to innate immunity and whose dysregulation contributes to human diseases. Genome wide analyses of translational control strive to identify differential translation independent of cytosolic mRNA levels. For this reason, most studies measure genes' translation levels as log ratios (translation levels divided by corresponding cytosolic mRNA levels obtained in parallel). Counterintuitively, arising from a mathematical necessity, these log ratios tend to be highly correlated with the cytosolic mRNA levels. Accordingly, they do not effectively correct for cytosolic mRNA level and generate substantial numbers of biological false positives and false negatives. We show that analysis of partial variance, which produces estimates of translational activity that are independent of cytosolic mRNA levels, is a superior alternative. When combined with a variance shrinkage method for estimating error variance, analysis of partial variance has the additional benefit of having greater statistical power and identifying fewer genes as translationally regulated resulting merely from unrealistically low variance estimates rather than from large changes in translational activity. In contrast to log ratios, this formal analytical approach estimates translation effects in a statistically rigorous manner, eliminates the need for inefficient and error-prone heuristics, and produces results that agree with biological function. The method is applicable to datasets obtained from both the commonly used polysome microarray method and the sequencing-based ribosome profiling method.},

When studying differential translation, levels of both actively translating mRNAs and total cytosolic mRNAs are obtained where the latter is used to correct for a possible contribution of differential cytosolic mRNA levels to the observed differential levels of actively translated mRNAs. We have recently shown that analysis of partial variance (APV) corrects for cytosolic mRNA levels more effectively than the commonly applied log ratio approach. APV provides a high degree of specificity and sensitivity for detecting biologically meaningful translation changes, especially when combined with a variance shrinkage method for estimating random error.

Here we report the genome-wide discovery of human transcripts that interact with eIF3 using photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP). eIF3 binds to a highly specific program of messenger RNAs involved in cell growth control processes, including cell cycling, differentiation and apoptosis, via the mRNA 5' untranslated region. Surprisingly, functional analysis of the interaction between eIF3 and two mRNAs encoding the cell proliferation regulators c-JUN and BTG1 reveals that eIF3 uses different modes of RNA stem-loop binding to exert either translational activation or repression. Our findings illuminate a new role for eIF3 in governing a specialized repertoire of gene expression and suggest that binding of eIF3 to specific mRNAs could be targeted to control carcinogenesis.},

Considering that mRNA translation is an energy demanding process, cancer cells must produce sufficient ATP to meet energy demand of hyperactive translational machinery. In recent years, the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) emerged as a central regulatory node which coordinates energy consumption by the translation apparatus and ATP production in mitochondria. Aberrant mTOR signaling underpins the vast majority of cancers whereby increased mTOR activity is thought to be a major determinant of both malignant translatomes and metabolomes. Nonetheless, the role of mTOR and other related signaling nodes (e.g. AMPK) in orchestrating protein synthesis and cancer energetics is only recently being unraveled. In this review, we discuss recent findings that provide insights into the molecular underpinnings of coordination of translational and metabolic programs of cancer cells, and potential strategies to translate these findings into clinical treatments.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine if high eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) overexpression (sevenfold elevation or more over benign breast tissue) is associated with a worse clinical outcome. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Dysregulation of cellular functions by selective overexpression of specific proteins can lead to malignant transformation. The overexpression of eIF4E preferentially increases translation of mRNAs with long, G-C rich 5'-untranslated regions. Selective gene products, such as tumor neoangiogenic factors, ornithine decarboxylase, and cyclin D1, are upregulated. METHODS: One hundred fourteen breast specimens were analyzed and eIF4E overexpression was quantified by Western blot analysis. Quantification for eIF4E protein level was accomplished using a rabbit anti-eIF4E antibody and colorimetric development of Western blots using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. The blots were scanned and analyzed by densitometry. Treatment, pathologic, and clinical outcome data variables were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed to determine if eIF4E overexpression is associated with breast cancer clinical outcome. RESULTS: In the 55 benign specimens, the mean eIF4E expression was 1.1+/-0.4 fold (mean +/- standard deviation). All 59 malignant breast carcinoma specimens were noted to have eIF4E overexpression (range, 1.9-fold to 30.6-fold), with a mean overexpression of 10.8+/-6.3-fold. The mean level of eIF4E expression in malignant specimens was higher than benign specimens (p {$<$} 0.05, unpaired t test). The degree of eIF4E overexpression appears to be independent of T and N stage. In the 21 patients with eIF4E overexpression of less than sevenfold, there was one cancer recurrence but no cancer-related deaths. In the 38 patients with high eIF4E overexpression (sevenfold or more), 14 patients had breast cancer recurrences (p = 0.03, log rank test), of whom 11 have died from the disease (p = 0.04, log rank test). The average follow-up interval in this study was 40 months. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stage I to III breast cancer and high eIF4E overexpression had a higher rate of cancer recurrence and a higher rate of cancer-related death when compared to similar-stage breast cancer patients with low eIF4E overexpression. Therefore, eIF4E protein overexpression may be of prognostic value in stage I to III breast carcinoma.},

The resultant E. coli data set transforms our understanding of the extent to which protein synthesis is precisely controlled to optimize function and efficiency. Members of multiprotein complexes are made in precise proportion to their stoichiometry, whereas components of functional modules are produced differentially according to their hierarchical role. Estimates of absolute protein abundance also reveal principles for optimizing design. These include how the level of different types of transcription factors is optimized for rapid response and how a metabolic pathway (methionine biosynthesis) balances production cost with activity requirements. Our studies reveal how general principles, important both for understanding natural systems and for synthesizing new ones, emerge from quantitative analyses of protein synthesis.},

This approach provides maps of ribosome activity for each expressed gene in a given biological sample. Measurements of translation efficiency are generated when Ribo-seq data is analyzed in combination with matched RNA-seq gene expression profiles. Existing computational methods for identifying genes with differential translation across samples are based on sound principles, but require users to choose between accuracy and speed. Results: We present Riborex, a computational tool for mapping genome-wide differences in translation efficiency. Riborex shares a similar mathematical structure with existing methods, but has a simplified implementation. Riborex directly leverages established RNA-seq analysis frameworks for all parameter estimation, providing users with a choice among robust engines for these computations. The result is a method that is dramatically faster than available methods without sacrificing accuracy. Availability and Implementation: https://github.com/smithlabcode/riborex.

This property makes polysome-profiling inconvenient for larger experimental designs or samples with low RNA amounts. To address this, we optimized a non-linear sucrose gradient which reproducibly enriches for efficiently translated mRNA in only one or two fractions, thereby reducing sample handling 5-10-fold. The technique generates polysome-associated RNA with a quality reflecting the starting material and, when coupled with smart-seq2 single-cell RNA sequencing, translatomes in small tissues from biobanks can be obtained. Translatomes acquired using optimized non-linear gradients resemble those obtained with the standard approach employing linear gradients. Polysome-profiling using optimized non-linear gradients in serum starved HCT-116 cells with or without p53 showed that p53 status associates with changes in mRNA abundance and translational efficiency leading to changes in protein levels. Moreover, p53 status also induced translational buffering whereby changes in mRNA levels are buffered at the level of mRNA translation. Thus, here we present a polysome-profiling technique applicable to large study designs, primary cells and frozen tissue samples such as those collected in biobanks.},

However, mTOR-sensitive translatomes commonly include mRNAs with a 5' terminal oligopyrimidine tract (TOP), such as those encoding ribosomal proteins, but not ISGs. Because these translatomes were obtained under conditions when ISG expression is not induced, we examined the mTOR-sensitive translatome in human WISH cells stimulated with IFN {$\beta$}. The mTOR inhibitor Torin1 resulted in a repression of global protein synthesis, including that of ISG products, and translation of all but 3 ISG mRNAs (TLR3, NT5C3A, and RNF19B) was not selectively more sensitive to mTOR inhibition. Detailed studies of NT5C3A revealed an IFN-induced change in transcription start site resulting in a switch from a non-TOP to a TOP-like transcript variant and mTOR sensitive translation. Thus, we show that, in the cell model used, translation of the vast majority of ISG mRNAs is not selectively sensitive to mTOR activity and describe an uncharacterized mechanism wherein the 5'-UTR of an mRNA is altered in response to a cytokine, resulting in a shift from mTOR-insensitive to mTOR-sensitive translation.},

Studies aiming to understand the impact of ER{$\alpha$} on cancer-associated phenotypes have largely been limited to its transcriptional activity. Herein, we demonstrate that ER{$\alpha$} coordinates its transcriptional output with selective modulation of mRNA translation. Importantly, translational perturbations caused by depletion of ER{$\alpha$} largely manifest as ?translational offsetting? of the transcriptome, whereby amounts of translated mRNAs and corresponding protein levels are maintained constant despite changes in mRNA abundance. Transcripts whose levels, but not polysome association, are reduced following ER{$\alpha$} depletion lack features which limit translation efficiency including structured 5?UTRs and miRNA target sites. In contrast, mRNAs induced upon ER{$\alpha$} depletion whose polysome association remains unaltered are enriched in codons requiring U34-modified tRNAs for efficient decoding. Consistently, ER{$\alpha$} regulates levels of U34-modifying enzymes and thereby controls levels of U34-modified tRNAs. These findings unravel a hitherto unprecedented mechanism of ER{$\alpha$}-dependent orchestration of transcriptional and translational programs that may be a pervasive mechanism of proteome maintenance in hormone-dependent cancers.},

TORC1 functions as an environmental sensor by integrating signals derived from diverse environmental cues to promote anabolic and inhibit catabolic cellular functions. mTORC1 (mammalian TORC1) phosphorylates and activates S6K1 and S6K2, whose first identified substrate was rpS6 (ribosomal protein S6), a component of the 40S ribosome. Studies over the past decade have uncovered a number of additional S6K1 substrates, revealing multiple levels at which the mTORC1-S6K1 axis regulates cell physiology. The results thus far indicate that the mTORC1-S6K1 axis controls fundamental cellular processes, including transcription, translation, protein and lipid synthesis, cell growth/size and cell metabolism. In the present review we summarize the regulation of S6Ks, their cellular substrates and functions, and their integration within rapidly expanding mTOR (mammalian TOR) signalling networks. Although our understanding of the role of mTORC1-S6K1 signalling in physiology remains in its infancy, evidence indicates that this signalling axis controls, at least in part, glucose homoeostasis, insulin sensitivity, adipocyte metabolism, body mass and energy balance, tissue and organ size, learning, memory and aging. As dysregulation of this signalling axis contributes to diverse disease states, improved understanding of S6K regulation and function within mTOR signalling networks may enable the development of novel therapeutics.},

The mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of translation. Although mTOR affects global protein synthesis, translation of a subset of mRNAs appears to be exceptionally sensitive to changes in mTOR activity. Recent efforts to catalog these mTOR-sensitive mRNAs resulted in conflicting results. Whereas ribosome-profiling almost exclusively identified 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNAs as mTOR-sensitive, polysome-profiling suggested that mTOR also regulates translation of non-TOP mRNAs. This inconsistency was explained by analytical and technical biases limiting the efficiency of ribosome-profiling in detecting mRNAs showing differential translation. Moreover, genome-wide characterization of 5'UTRs of non-TOP mTOR-sensitive mRNAs revealed 2 subsets of transcripts which differ in their requirement for translation initiation factors and biologic functions.

It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation analyses.},

Much work has shown that mRNA abundance is highly variable between closely related species. However, the extent and mechanisms of post-transcriptional gene regulatory evolution are largely unknown. Here we used ribosome profiling to compare transcript abundance and translation efficiency in two closely related yeast species (S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus). By comparing translation regulatory divergence to interspecies differences in mRNA sequence features, we show that differences in transcript leaders and codon bias substantially contribute to divergent translation. Globally, we find that translation regulatory divergence often buffers species differences in mRNA abundance, such that ribosome occupancy is more conserved than transcript abundance. We used allele-specific ribosome profiling in interspecies hybrids to compare the relative contributions of cis- and trans-regulatory divergence to species differences in mRNA abundance and translation efficiency. The mode of gene regulatory divergence differs for these processes, as trans-regulatory changes play a greater role in divergent mRNA abundance than in divergent translation efficiency. Strikingly, most genes with aberrant transcript abundance in F1 hybrids (either over- or underexpressed compared to both parent species) did not exhibit aberrant ribosome occupancy. Our results show that interspecies differences in translation contribute substantially to the evolution of gene expression. Compensatory differences in transcript abundance and translation efficiency may increase the robustness of gene regulation.},

However, some transcripts are translated in a cap-independent manner through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we show that mRNAs containing N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) in their 5' UTR can be translated in a cap-independent manner. A single 5' UTR m(6)A directly binds eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), which is sufficient to recruit the 43S complex to initiate translation in the absence of the cap-binding factor eIF4E. Inhibition of adenosine methylation selectively reduces translation of mRNAs containing 5'UTR m(6)A. Additionally, increased m(6)A levels in the Hsp70 mRNA regulate its cap-independent translation following heat shock. Notably, we find that diverse cellular stresses induce a transcriptome-wide redistribution of m(6)A, resulting in increased numbers of mRNAs with 5' UTR m(6)A. These data show that 5' UTR m(6)A bypasses 5' cap-binding proteins to promote translation under stresses.},

  abstract = {Age-dependent senescence is a multifaceted and highly coordinated developmental phase in the life of plants that is manifested with genetic, biochemical and phenotypic continuum. Thus, elucidating the dynamic network modeling and simulation of molecular events, in particular gene regulatory network during the onset of senescence is essential. Here, we constructed a computational pipeline that integrates senescence-related co-expression networks with transcription factor (TF)-promoter relationships and microRNA (miR)-target interactions. Network structural and functional analyses revealed important nodes within each module of these co-expression networks. Subsequently, we inferred significant dynamic transcriptional regulatory models in leaf senescence using time-course gene expression datasets. Dynamic simulations and predictive network perturbation analyses followed by experimental dataset illustrated the kinetic relationships among TFs and their downstream targets. In conclusion, our network science framework discovers cohorts of TFs and their paths with previously unrecognized roles in leaf senescence and provides a comprehensive landscape of dynamic transcriptional circuitry.},

  abstract = {Control of gene expression in erythropoiesis has to respond to signals that may emerge from intracellular processes or environmental factors. Control of mRNA translation allows for relatively rapid modulation of protein synthesis from the existing transcriptome. For instance, the protein synthesis rate needs to be reduced when reactive oxygen species or unfolded proteins accumulate in the cells, but also when iron supply is low or when growth factors are lacking in the environment. In addition, regulation of mRNA translation can be important as an additional layer of control on top of gene transcription, in which RNA binding proteins (RBPs) can modify translation of a set of transcripts to the cell's actual protein requirement. The 5' and 3' untranslated regions of mRNA (5'UTR, 3'UTR) contain binding sites for general and sequence specific translation factors. They also contain secondary structures that may hamper scanning of the 5'UTR by translation complexes or may help to recruit translation factors. In addition, the term 5'UTR is not fully correct because many transcripts contain small open reading frames in their 5'UTR that are translated and contribute to regulation of mRNA translation. It is becoming increasingly clear that the transcriptome only partly predicts the proteome. The aim of this review is (i) to summarize how the availability of general translation initiation factors can selectively regulate transcripts because the 5'UTR contains secondary structures or short translated sequences, (ii) to discuss mechanisms that control the length of the mRNA poly(A) tail in relation to mRNA translation, and (iii) to give examples of sequence specific RBPs and their targets. We focused on transcripts and RBPs required for erythropoiesis. Whereas differentiation of erythroblasts to erythrocytes is orchestrated by erythroid transcription factors, the production of erythrocytes needs to respond to the availability of growth factors and nutrients, particularly the availability of iron.},

Relative to mRNAs which were polyadenylated, we found that nonpolyadenylated [poly(A)-]mRNAs had a reduced translational capacity which was not due to an increase in their decay rates, but was attributable to a reduction in their efficiency of recruitment into polysomes. The defect in poly(A)- mRNAs affected a late step in translational initiation, was distinct from the phenotype associated with cap-deficient mRNAs, and resulted in a reduced ability to form 80S initiation complexes. Moreover, poly(A) added in trans inhibited translation from capped polyadenylated mRNAs but stimulated translation from capped poly(A)- mRNAs.

In this study, we find that mTORC2 can colocalize with actively translating ribosomes and can stably interact with rpL23a, a large ribosomal subunit protein present at the tunnel exit. Exclusively during translation of Akt, mTORC2 mediates phosphorylation of the nascent polypeptide at the turn motif (TM) site, Thr450, to avoid cotranslational Akt ubiquitination. Constitutive TM phosphorylation occurs because the TM site is accessible, whereas the hydrophobic motif (Ser473) site is concealed in the ribosomal tunnel. Thus, mTORC2 can function cotranslationally by phosphorylating residues in nascent chains that are critical to attain proper conformation. Our findings reveal that mTOR links protein production with quality control.},

A detailed understanding of the control of gene expression at the level of messenger RNA translation is vital to elucidating a systems-level view of complex molecular programs in the cell. Establishing the degree to which such post-transcriptional regulation can mediate specific phenotypes is similarly critical to elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of diseases such as cancer. Recently, methods for massively parallel sequencing of ribosome-bound fragments of messenger RNA have begun to uncover genome-wide translational control at codon resolution. Despite its promise for deeply characterizing mammalian proteomes, few analytical methods exist for the comprehensive analysis of this paired RNA and ribosome data. RESULTS: We describe the Babel framework, an analytical methodology for assessing the significance of changes in translational regulation within cells and between conditions. This approach facilitates the analysis of translation genome-wide while allowing statistically principled gene-level inference. Babel is based on an errors-in-variables regression model that uses the negative binomial distribution and draws inference using a parametric bootstrap approach. We demonstrate the operating characteristics of Babel on simulated data and use its gene-level inference to extend prior analyses significantly, discovering new translationally regulated modules under mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway signaling control.},

The core event in this pathway is the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2{$\alpha$}) by one of four members of the eIF2{$\alpha$} kinase family, which leads to a decrease in global protein synthesis and the induction of selected genes, including the transcription factor ATF4, that together promote cellular recovery. The gene expression program activated by the ISR optimizes the cellular response to stress and is dependent on the cellular context, as well as on the nature and intensity of the stress stimuli. Although the ISR is primarily a pro-survival, homeostatic program, exposure to severe stress can drive signaling toward cell death. Here, we review current understanding of the ISR signaling and how it regulates cell fate under diverse types of stress.},

This mechanism is position dependent; reporter mRNAs bearing IREs located further downstream exhibit diminished translational control in transfected mammalian cells. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we have recapitulated this position effect in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free translation system. We show that the recruitment of the 43S preinitiation complex to the mRNA is unaffected when IRP-1 is bound to a cap-distal IRE. Following 43S complex recruitment, the translation initiation apparatus appears to stall, before linearly progressing to the initiation codon. The slow passive dissociation rate of IRP-1 from the cap-distal IRE suggests that the mammalian translation apparatus plays an active role in overcoming the cap-distal IRE\textendash IRP-1 complex. In contrast, cap-distal IRE\textendash IRP-1 complexes efficiently repress translation in wheat germ and yeast translation extracts. Since inhibition occurs subsequent to 43S complex recruitment, an efficient arrest of productive scanning may represent a second mechanism by which RNA-protein interactions within the 5{${'}$} untranslated region of an mRNA can regulate translation. In contrast to initiating ribosomes, elongating ribosomes from mammal, plant, and yeast cells are unaffected by IRE\textendash IRP-1 complexes positioned within the open reading frame. These data shed light on a characteristic aspect of the IRE-IRP regulatory system and uncover properties of the initiation and elongation translation apparatus of eukaryotic cells.},

In the present study, we report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1 (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are components of mTORC2. We demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Protor-1 or Protor-2 results in the co-immunoprecipitation of other mTORC2 subunits, but not Raptor, a specific component of mTORC1. We show that detergents such as Triton X-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate mTOR and mLST8 from a complex of Protor-1, Sin1 and Rictor. We also provide evidence that Rictor regulates the expression of Protor-1, and that Protor-1 is not required for the assembly of other mTORC2 subunits into a complex. Protor-1 is a novel Rictor-binding subunit of mTORC2, but further work is required to establish its role.},

Using a microarray-based strategy, we find that, within minutes after the induction of amino acid starvation, the splicing of the majority of RPGs is specifically inhibited. In response to an unrelated stress, exposure to toxic levels of ethanol, splicing of a different group of transcripts is inhibited, while the splicing of a third set is actually improved.

Antizyme mRNA translation depends upon a polyamine-stimulated +1 ribosomal frameshift, forming a complex negative feedback system in which the translational frameshifting event may be viewed in engineering terms as a feedback controller for intracellular polyamine concentrations. In this article, we present the first systems level study of the characteristics of this feedback controller, using an integrated experimental and modeling approach. Quantitative analysis of mutant yeast strains in which polyamine synthesis and interconversion were blocked revealed marked variations in frameshift responses to the different polyamines. Putrescine and spermine, but not spermidine, showed evidence of co-operative stimulation of frameshifting and the existence of multiple ribosome binding sites. Combinatorial polyamine treatments showed polyamines compete for binding to common ribosome sites. Using concepts from enzyme kinetics and control engineering, a mathematical model of the translational controller was developed to describe these complex ribosomal responses to combinatorial polyamine effects. Each one of a range of model predictions was successfully validated against experimental frameshift frequencies measured in S-adenosylmethionine-decarboxylase and antizyme mutants, as well as in the wild-type genetic background.},

PI3K inhibitors thus have considerable potential as molecular cancer therapeutics. Here, we detail the pharmacologic properties of a prototype of a new series of inhibitors of class I PI3K. PI103 is a potent inhibitor with low IC50 values against recombinant PI3K isoforms p110alpha (2 nmol/L), p110beta (3 nmol/L), p110delta (3 nmol/L), and p110gamma (15 nmol/L). PI103 also inhibited TORC1 by 83.9\% at 0.5 micromol/L and exhibited an IC50 of 14 nmol/L against DNA-PK. A high degree of selectivity for the PI3K family was shown by the lack of activity of PI103 in a panel of 70 protein kinases. PI103 potently inhibited proliferation and invasion of a wide variety of human cancer cells in vitro and showed biomarker modulation consistent with inhibition of PI3K signaling. PI103 was extensively metabolized, but distributed rapidly to tissues and tumors. This resulted in tumor growth delay in eight different human cancer xenograft models with various PI3K pathway abnormalities. Decreased phosphorylation of AKT was observed in U87MG gliomas, consistent with drug levels achieved. We also showed inhibition of invasion in orthotopic breast and ovarian cancer xenograft models and obtained evidence that PI103 has antiangiogenic potential. Despite its rapid in vivo metabolism, PI103 is a valuable tool compound for exploring the biological function of class I PI3K and importantly represents a lead for further optimization of this novel class of targeted molecular cancer therapeutic.},

  abstract = {Although protein synthesis dynamics has been studied both with theoretical models and by profiling ribosome footprints, the determinants of ribosome flux along open reading frames (ORFs) are not fully understood. Combining measurements of protein synthesis rate with ribosome footprinting data, we here inferred translation initiation and elongation rates for over a 1,000 ORFs in exponentially growing wild-type yeast cells. We found that the amino acid composition of synthesized proteins is as important a determinant of translation elongation rate as parameters related to codon and transfer RNA (tRNA) adaptation. We did not find evidence of ribosome collisions curbing the protein output of yeast transcripts, either in high translation conditions associated with exponential growth, or in strains in which deletion of individual ribosomal protein (RP) genes leads to globally increased or decreased translation. Slow translation elongation is characteristic of RP-encoding transcripts, which have markedly lower protein output compared with other transcripts with equally high ribosome densities.},

It has now been established that genetic alterations in several components of the translational apparatus underlie spontaneous cancers as well as an entire class of inherited syndromes known as "ribosomopathies" associated with increased cancer susceptibility. These discoveries have illuminated the importance of deregulations in translational control to very specific cellular processes that contribute to cancer etiology. In addition, a growing body of evidence supports the view that deregulation of translational control is a common mechanism by which diverse oncogenic pathways promote cellular transformation and tumor development. Indeed, activation of these key oncogenic pathways induces rapid and dramatic translational reprogramming both by increasing overall protein synthesis and by modulating specific mRNA networks. These translational changes promote cellular transformation, impacting almost every phase of tumor development. This paradigm represents a new frontier in the multihit model of cancer formation and offers significant promise for innovative cancer therapies. Current research, in conjunction with cutting edge technologies, will further enable us to explore novel mechanisms of translational control, functionally identify translationally controlled mRNA groups, and unravel their impact on cellular transformation and tumorigenesis.},

The aim of this study was to determine the level of expression of eIF4E and eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) in esophageal cancer. DESIGN AND METHODS: Tumor and normal adjacent tissue samples (as controls) were obtained from 99 patients with esophageal cancer. eIF4E and 4E-BP1 levels were determined by using Western blot analysis. eIF4E was purified by affinity chromatography using m(7)GTP-sepharose, and the levels of 4E-BP1 bound to eIF4E were determined. RESULTS: : In cancerous esophageal tissues, eIF4E level was elevated by a mean of 12.59 +/- 1.66-fold, and 4E-BP1 was elevated by a mean of 15.76 +/- 2.45-fold when compared to normal adjacent tissues. Both eIF4E and 4E-BP1 expressions were higher in cancerous compared to noncancerous esophageal tissues. CONCLUSIONS: A higher expression of eIF4E was correlated with advanced stages. The inverse relationship found between the increases in 4E-BP1 levels observed in esophagus tumors and lymph node involvement would support the hypothesis that the overexpression of eIF4E can be involved in tumorigenesis and a possible role of 4E-BP1 as a prognostic factor in esophageal cancer.},

Pathways of TOR activation in plants remain unknown. Here, we uncover the role of the phytohormone auxin in TOR signalling activation and reinitiation after upstream open reading frame (uORF) translation, which in plants is dependent on translation initiation factor eIF3h. We show that auxin triggers TOR activation followed by S6K1 phosphorylation at T449 and efficient loading of uORF-mRNAs onto polysomes in a manner sensitive to the TOR inhibitor Torin-1. Torin-1 mediates recruitment of inactive S6K1 to polysomes, while auxin triggers S6K1 dissociation and recruitment of activated TOR instead. A putative target of TOR/S6K1-eIF3h-is phosphorylated and detected in polysomes in response to auxin. In TOR-deficient plants, polysomes were prebound by inactive S6K1, and loading of uORF-mRNAs and eIF3h was impaired. Transient expression of eIF3h-S178D in plant protoplasts specifically upregulates uORF-mRNA translation. We propose that TOR functions in polysomes to maintain the active S6K1 (and thus eIF3h) phosphorylation status that is critical for translation reinitiation.},

However, MM recurrences in bortezomib-treated patients are invariable. We have shown that ER stress signaling can also induce growth arrest and survival in cancer cells. Thus, we hypothesized that bortezomib therapy could induce quiescence and survival of residual MM cells, contributing to disease recurrence. Here, we report that in MM cells, proteasome inhibition with MG-132 or bortezomib results in a surviving cell fraction that enters a prolonged quiescent state (G0\textendash G1 arrest). Mechanism analysis revealed that bortezomib-surviving quiescent cells attenuate eIF2{$\alpha$} phosphorylation and induction of the ER stress proapoptotic gene GADD153. This occurs independently of the eIF2{$\alpha$} upstream kinases PERK, GCN2, and PKR. In contrast, the prosurvival ER-chaperone BiP/Grp78 was persistently induced. The bortezomib-surviving quiescent fraction could be eradicated by a simultaneous or sequential combination therapy with salubrinal, an inhibitor of GADD34-PP1C phosphatase complex, and, in consequence, eIF2{$\alpha$} dephosphorylation. This effect was mimicked by expression of a phosphorylated mimetic eIF2{$\alpha$}-S51D mutant. Our data indicate that bortezomib can induce growth arrest in therapy-surviving MM cells and that attenuation of eIF2{$\alpha$} phosphorylation contributes to this survival. Most importantly, this survival mechanism can be blocked by inhibiting eIF2{$\alpha$} dephosphorylation. Thus, strategies that maintain eIF2{$\alpha$} in a hyperphosphorylated state may be a novel therapeutic approach to maximize bortezomib-induced apoptosis and reduce residual disease and recurrences in this type of cancer.},

It is uniquely poised to coordinate overall cell proliferation by its effects on both growth and division. A number of translation initiation factors are transcriptional targets of c-myc in a variety of assays. In particular, the mRNA cap-binding protein eIF4E has a myc-binding sequence in its promoter that is myc responsive in reporter assays and contains a high-affinity myc-binding site in chromosome immunoprecipitation experiments. Several differential expression screens have demonstrated altered levels of eIF4E, along with several other translation initiation factors, in response to alterations of c-myc levels. The potential for eIF4E and other translational control elements to mediate myc's transforming functions is particularly important because eIF4E is itself a known oncogenic factor. The ability of translation initiation factors to affect both cell division control and cell growth control coincides with myc's remarkable effects on both cell growth and cell division.},

Whereas mRNA and protein levels correlated better than previously thought, corresponding half-lives showed no correlation. Using a quantitative model we have obtained the first genome-scale prediction of synthesis rates of mRNAs and proteins. We find that the cellular abundance of proteins is predominantly controlled at the level of translation. Genes with similar combinations of mRNA and protein stability shared functional properties, indicating that half-lives evolved under energetic and dynamic constraints.

This process requires the presence of a poly(A)-binding protein. However, the cytoplasmic somatic cell poly(A)-binding protein (PABP1) is not expressed until later in embryogenesis. We recently identified an embryonic poly(A)-binding protein (ePAB) in Xenopus. ePAB is the predominant cytoplasmic PABP in Xenopus oocytes and early embryos and prevents deadenylation of mRNAs, suggesting its importance in the regulation of gene expression during early Xenopus development. Here we report the identification of the mouse ortholog of Xenopus ePAB. The mouse ePAB gene on chromosome 2 contains 14 exons that specify an alternatively spliced mRNA encoding a protein of 608 or 561 aa with {$\approx$}65\% identity to Xenopus ePAB. Mouse ePAB mRNA is expressed in ovaries and testis but not in somatic tissues. In situ hybridization localizes ePAB RNA to oocytes and confirms its absence from surrounding somatic cells in the mouse ovary. During early development, mouse ePAB is expressed in prophase I and metaphase II oocytes and one-cell and two-cell embryos and then becomes undetectable in four-or-more-cell embryos. In contrast, PABP1 mRNA expression is minimal in oocytes and early embryos until the eight-cell stage when it increases, becoming predominant at the blastocyst stage. The expression of mouse ePAB before zygotic gene activation argues for its importance in translational activation of maternally derived mRNAs during mammalian oocyte and early preimplantation embryo development.},

  abstract = {The integrated stress response (ISR) is a cytoprotective pathway initiated upon phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2{$\alpha$}) residue designated serine-51, which is critical for translational control in response to various stress conditions. Four eIF2{$\alpha$} kinases, namely heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), protein kinase R (PKR), PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, (PERK) and general control non-depressible 2 (GCN2), have been identified thus far, and they are known to be activated by heme depletion, viral infection, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and amino acid starvation, respectively. Because eIF2{$\alpha$} is phosphorylated under various stress conditions, the existence of an additional eIF2{$\alpha$} kinase has been suggested. To validate the existence of the unidentified eIF2{$\alpha$} kinase, we constructed an eIF2{$\alpha$} kinase quadruple knockout cells (4KO cells) in which the four known eIF2{$\alpha$} kinase genes were deleted using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. Phosphorylation of eIF2{$\alpha$} was completely abolished in the 4KO cells by various stress stimulations. Our data suggests that the four known eIF2{$\alpha$} kinases are sufficient for ISR and that there are no additional eIF2{$\alpha$} kinases in vertebrates.},

Although mTOR globally promotes translation by regulating the mRNA 5' cap-binding protein eIF4E (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E), it also preferentially regulates the translation of certain classes of mRNA via unclear mechanisms. To help fill this gap in knowledge, we performed a quantitative proteomic screen to identify proteins that associate with the mRNA 5' cap in an mTOR-dependent manner. Using this approach, we identified many potential regulatory factors, including the putative RNA-binding protein LARP1 (La-related protein 1). Our results indicate that LARP1 associates with actively translating ribosomes via PABP and that LARP1 stimulates the translation of mRNAs containing a 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motif, encoding for components of the translational machinery. We found that LARP1 associates with the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and is required for global protein synthesis as well as cell growth and proliferation. Together, these data reveal important molecular mechanisms involved in TOP mRNA translation and implicate LARP1 as an important regulator of cell growth and proliferation.},

Concerted action of canonical eukaryotic initiation factors and IRES transacting factors (ITAFs) was shown to regulate cellular IRES mediated translation; however, the precise molecular mechanism of ribosome recruitment to cellular IRESes remains unclear. Here we show that the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) IRES operates in an evolutionary conserved viral like mode and the structural integrity, particularly in the vicinity of AUG, is critical for ribosome recruitment. The binding of eIF3 together with PABP potentiates ribosome recruitment to the IRES. Our data support the model in which eIF3 binds directly to the XIAP IRES RNA in a structure-dependent manner and acts as a scaffold for IRES RNA, PABP and the 40S ribosome.},

Translation and energy metabolism play important roles in homeostatic cell growth and proliferation, and when dysregulated lead to cancer. eIF4E is a key regulator of translation, which promotes oncogenesis by selectively enhancing translation of a subset of tumor-promoting mRNAs (e.g., cyclins and c-myc). PI3K/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which are strongly implicated in cancer etiology, exert a number of their biological effects by modulating translation. The PI3K/AKT pathway regulates eIF4E function by inactivating the inhibitory 4E-BPs via mTORC1, whereas MAPKs activate MAP kinase signal-integrating kinases 1 and 2, which phosphorylate eIF4E. In addition, AMP-activated protein kinase, which is a central sensor of the cellular energy balance, impairs translation by inhibiting mTORC1. Thus, eIF4E plays a major role in mediating the effects of PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and cellular energetics on mRNA translation.},

FMRP and cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB), an activator of translation, are present in neuronal dendrites, are predicted to bind many of the same mRNAs and may mediate a translational homeostasis that, when imbalanced, results in FXS. Consistent with this possibility, Fmr1(-/y); Cpeb1(-/-) double-knockout mice displayed amelioration of biochemical, morphological, electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes associated with FXS. Acute depletion of CPEB1 in the hippocampus of adult Fmr1(-/y) mice rescued working memory deficits, demonstrating reversal of this FXS phenotype. Finally, we find that FMRP and CPEB1 balance translation at the level of polypeptide elongation. Our results suggest that disruption of translational homeostasis is causal for FXS and that the maintenance of this homeostasis by FMRP and CPEB1 is necessary for normal neurologic function.},

  abstract = {Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare bone marrow failure disorder that affects 7 out of 1,000,000 live births and has been associated with mutations in components of the ribosome. In order to characterize the genetic landscape of this heterogeneous disorder, we recruited a cohort of 472 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of DBA and performed whole-exome sequencing (WES). We identified relevant rare and predicted damaging mutations for 78\% of individuals. The majority of mutations were singletons, absent from population databases, predicted to cause loss of function, and located in 1 of 19 previously reported ribosomal protein (RP)-encoding genes. Using exon coverage estimates, we identified and validated 31 deletions in RP genes. We also observed an enrichment for extended splice site mutations and validated their diverse effects using RNA sequencing in cell lines obtained from individuals with DBA. Leveraging the size of our cohort, we observed robust genotype-phenotype associations with congenital abnormalities and treatment outcomes. We further identified rare mutations in seven previously unreported RP genes that may cause DBA, as well as several distinct disorders that appear to phenocopy DBA, including nine individuals with biallelic CECR1 mutations that result in deficiency of ADA2. However, no new genes were identified at exome-wide significance, suggesting that there are no unidentified genes containing mutations readily identified by WES that explain {$>$}5\% of DBA-affected case subjects. Overall, this report should inform not only clinical practice for DBA-affected individuals, but also the design and analysis of rare variant studies for heterogeneous Mendelian disorders.},

Insulin induces dephosphorylation of eEF2 and inactivation of eEF2 kinase, and these effects are blocked by rapamycin, which inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR. However, the signalling mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown. Regulation of eEF2 phosphorylation and eEF2k activity is lost in cells in which phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) has been genetically knocked out. This is not due to loss of mTOR function since phosphorylation of another target of mTOR, initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, is not defective. PDK1 is required for activation of members of the AGC kinase family; we show that two such kinases, p70 S6 kinase (regulated via mTOR) and p90(RSK1) (activated by Erk), phosphorylate eEF2k at a conserved serine and inhibit its activity. In response to insulin-like growth factor 1, which activates p70 S6 kinase but not Erk, regulation of eEF2 is blocked by rapamycin. In contrast, regulation of eEF2 by stimuli that activate Erk is insensitive to rapamycin, but blocked by inhibitors of MEK/Erk signalling, consistent with the involvement of p90(RSK1).},

METHODS: Western blotting was performed to quantify the elF4E protein expression in the normal human liver cell line L02 and the hepatoma cell lines Hep3B, HepG2, and Huh7. Forty-six hepatocellular carcinoma samples with complete clinical data were obtained from Changzheng Hospital during the period of December 2008 to July 2009. The expression of eIF4E in the tumor samples and their adjacent tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between the test results and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis was statistically analysed by using a COX proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Western blotting analysis showed that there were distinct eIF4E protein bands in all three of the hepatoma cell lines. In particular, the HepG2 cell line had the highest level of eIF4E protein expression. The L02 cell group had a low eIF4E expression. Immunohistochemical assay showed that there were 32 cases in which the tumour tissue expression was higher than their adjacent tissues, accounting for 69.57\%. There were also 14 cases in which the tumour tissue expression was lower or no significant difference was found, accounting for 30.43\%. COX proportional hazards model analysis showed that HCC prognosis was related to the depth of invasion, the overexpression of eIF4E and p53, possibly as independent HCC prognostic predictors. CONCLUSION: In summary, eIF4E expression is associated with liver cancer, and patients with high eIF4E expression levels have a higher risk of recurrence.},

Unfortunately expense and limited specimen availability often lead to studies with small sample sizes. This makes accurate estimation of variability difficult, since variance estimates made on a gene by gene basis will have few degrees of freedom, and the assumption that all genes share equal variance is unlikely to be true. RESULTS: We propose a model by which the within gene variances are drawn from an inverse gamma distribution, whose parameters are estimated across all genes. This results in a test statistic that is a minor variation of those used in standard linear models. We demonstrate that the model assumptions are valid on experimental data, and that the model has more power than standard tests to pick up large changes in expression, while not increasing the rate of false positives.

Thus, we performed a comprehensive detection of terminal oligo-pyrimidine (TOP), which is one of the well-characterized cis-regulatory motifs for translational controls located immediately downstream of the transcriptional start sites of mRNAs. Utilizing our precise 5'-end information of the full-length cDNAs, we could screen 1645 candidate TOP genes by position specific matrix search. Among them, not only 75 out of 78 ribosomal protein genes but also eight previously identified non-ribosomal-protein TOP genes were included. We further experimentally validated the translational activities of 83 TOP candidate genes. Clear translational regulations exerted on the stimulation of 12-O-tetradecanoyl-1-phorbol-13-acetate for at least 41 of them was observed, indicating that there should be a few hundreds of human genes which are subjected to regulation at translation levels via TOPs. Our result suggests that TOP genes code not only formerly characterized ribosomal proteins and translation-related proteins but also a wider variety of proteins, such as lysosome-related proteins and metabolism-related proteins, playing pivotal roles in gene expression controls in the majority of cellular mRNAs.},

  abstract = {Pdcd4 is a novel transformation suppressor that inhibits tumor promoter-induced neoplastic transformation and the activation of AP-1-dependent transcription required for transformation. A yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that Pdcd4 associates with the eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF4AI and eIF4AII. Immunofluorescent confocal microscopy showed that Pdcd4 colocalizes with eIF4A in the cytoplasm. eIF4A is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase needed to unwind 5' mRNA secondary structure. Recombinant Pdcd4 specifically inhibited the helicase activity of eIF4A and eIF4F. In vivo translation assays showed that Pdcd4 inhibited cap-dependent but not internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation. In contrast, Pdcd4(D418A), a mutant inactivated for binding to eIF4A, failed to inhibit cap-dependent or IRES-dependent translation or AP-1 transactivation. Recombinant Pdcd4 prevented eIF4A from binding to the C-terminal region of eIF4G (amino acids 1040 to 1560) but not to the middle region of eIF4G(amino acids 635 to 1039). In addition, both Pdcd4 and Pdcd4(D418A) bound to the middle region of eIF4G. The mechanism by which Pdcd4 inhibits translation thus appears to involve inhibition of eIF4A helicase, interference with eIF4A association-dissociation from eIF4G, and inhibition of eIF4A binding to the C-terminal domain of eIF4G. Pdcd4 binding to eIF4A is linked to its transformation-suppressing activity, as Pdcd4-eIF4A binding and consequent inhibition of translation are required for Pdcd4 transrepression of AP-1.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Deep sequencing based ribosome footprint profiling can provide novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms of protein translation. However, the observed ribosome profile is fundamentally confounded by transcriptional activity. In order to decipher principles of translation regulation, tools that can reliably detect changes in translation efficiency in case-control studies are needed. RESULTS: We present a statistical framework and an analysis tool, RiboDiff, to detect genes with changes in translation efficiency across experimental treatments. RiboDiff uses generalized linear models to estimate the over-dispersion of RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling measurements separately, and performs a statistical test for differential translation efficiency using both mRNA abundance and ribosome occupancy.

  abstract = {Adenovirus dodecahedron (Dd), a nanoparticulate proteinaceous biodegradable virus-like particle (VLP), was used as a vector for delivery of an oncogene inhibitor to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rat orthotopic model. Initiation factor eIF4E is an oncogene with elevated expression in human cancers. Cell-impermeant eIF4E inhibitor, cap structure analog (cap) and anti-cancer antibiotic doxorubicin (Dox) were delivered as Dd conjugates. Dd-cap and Dd-dox inhibited cancer cell culture proliferation up to 50 and 84\%, respectively, while with free Dox similar results could be obtained only at a 5 times higher concentration. In animal HCC model the combination treatment of Dd-cap/Dd-dox caused 40\% inhibition of tumor growth. Importantly, the level of two pro-oncogenes, eIF4E and c-myc, was significantly diminished in tumor sections of treated rats. Attachment to Dd, a virus-like particle, permitted the first demonstration of cap analog intracellular delivery and resulted in improved doxorubicin delivery leading to statistically significant inhibition of HCC tumor growth.},
