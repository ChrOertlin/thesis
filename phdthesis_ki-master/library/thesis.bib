	abstract = {Polysome-profiling is commonly used to study translatomes and applies laborious extraction of efficiently translated {mRNA} (associated with {\textgreater}3 ribosomes) from a large volume across many fractions. This property makes polysome-profiling inconvenient for larger experimental designs or samples with low {RNA} amounts. To address this, we optimized a non-linear sucrose gradient which reproducibly enriches for efficiently translated {mRNA} in only one or two fractions, thereby reducing sample handling 5-10-fold. The technique generates polysome-associated {RNA} with a quality reflecting the starting material and, when coupled with smart-seq2 single-cell {RNA} sequencing, translatomes in small tissues from biobanks can be obtained. Translatomes acquired using optimized non-linear gradients resemble those obtained with the standard approach employing linear gradients. Polysome-profiling using optimized non-linear gradients in serum starved {HCT}-116 cells with or without p53 showed that p53 status associates with changes in {mRNA} abundance and translational efficiency leading to changes in protein levels. Moreover, p53 status also induced translational buffering whereby changes in {mRNA} levels are buffered at the level of {mRNA} translation. Thus, here we present a polysome-profiling technique applicable to large study designs, primary cells and frozen tissue samples such as those collected in biobanks.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ({PDA}) is a lethal malignancy with limited treatment options. Although metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of many cancers, including {PDA}, previous attempts to target metabolic changes therapeutically have been stymied by drug toxicity and tumour cell plasticity. Here, we show that {PDA} cells engage an {eIF}4F-dependent translation program that supports redox and central carbon metabolism. Inhibition of the {eIF}4F subunit, {eIF}4A, using the synthetic rocaglate {CR}-1-31-B ({CR}-31) reduced the viability of {PDA} organoids relative to their normal counterparts. In vivo, {CR}-31 suppresses tumour growth and extends survival of genetically-engineered murine models of {PDA}. Surprisingly, inhibition of {eIF}4A also induces glutamine reductive carboxylation. As a consequence, combined targeting of {eIF}4A and glutaminase activity more effectively inhibits {PDA} cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our work demonstrates the importance of {eIF}4A in translational control of pancreatic tumour metabolism and as a therapeutic target against {PDA}.},

Consistent with this possibility, Fmr1(-/y); Cpeb1(-/-) double-knockout mice displayed amelioration of biochemical, morphological, electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes associated with {FXS}. Acute depletion of {CPEB}1 in the hippocampus of adult Fmr1(-/y) mice rescued working memory deficits, demonstrating reversal of this {FXS} phenotype. Finally, we find that {FMRP} and {CPEB}1 balance translation at the level of polypeptide elongation. Our results suggest that disruption of translational homeostasis is causal for {FXS} and that the maintenance of this homeostasis by {FMRP} and {CPEB}1 is necessary for normal neurologic function.},

Here, we use high-throughput sequencing of {RNAs} isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation ({HITS}-{CLIP}) to identify {FMRP} interactions with mouse brain polyribosomal {mRNAs}. {FMRP} interacts with the coding region of transcripts encoding pre- and postsynaptic proteins and transcripts implicated in autism spectrum disorders ({ASD}). We developed a brain polyribosome-programmed translation system, revealing that {FMRP} reversibly stalls ribosomes specifically on its target {mRNAs}. Our results suggest that loss of a translational brake on the synthesis of a subset of synaptic proteins contributes to {FXS}. In addition, they provide insight into the molecular basis of the cognitive and allied defects in {FXS} and {ASD} and suggest multiple targets for clinical intervention.

Combining measurements of protein synthesis rate with ribosome footprinting data, we here inferred translation initiation and elongation rates for over a 1,000 {ORFs} in exponentially growing wild-type yeast cells. We found that the amino acid composition of synthesized proteins is as important a determinant of translation elongation rate as parameters related to codon and transfer {RNA} ({tRNA}) adaptation. We did not find evidence of ribosome collisions curbing the protein output of yeast transcripts, either in high translation conditions associated with exponential growth, or in strains in which deletion of individual ribosomal protein ({RP}) genes leads to globally increased or decreased translation. Slow translation elongation is characteristic of {RP}-encoding transcripts, which have markedly lower protein output compared with other transcripts with equally high ribosome densities.},

Initiation complex formation on globin {mRNA}, or on capped viral {RNAs} such as papaya mosaic virus {RNA} and tobacco mosaic virus {RNA}, was strongly stimulated by {ATP}. In contrast, initiation complex formation on (uncapped) encephalomyocarditis virus {RNA} was uninfluenced by the presence or absence of {ATP}, which may be correlated with the recent evidence for scanning-independent internal initiation on this viral {RNA}. In addition, initiation complex formation on uncapped cowpea mosaic virus {RNA} and on poly(A,U,G) was only slightly stimulated by {ATP}, much less than in the case of the capped {RNAs}. These results suggest that most of the {ATP} hydrolysed during translation initiation is consumed in cap-dependent processes, probably in unwinding the {mRNA}, and relatively little in the actual migration or scanning of 40S subunits along the {mRNA}.},

	abstract = {Pdcd4 is a novel transformation suppressor that inhibits tumor promoter-induced neoplastic transformation and the activation of {AP}-1-dependent transcription required for transformation. A yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that Pdcd4 associates with the eukaryotic translation initiation factors {eIF}4AI and {eIF}4AII. Immunofluorescent confocal microscopy showed that Pdcd4 colocalizes with {eIF}4A in the cytoplasm. {eIF}4A is an {ATP}-dependent {RNA} helicase needed to unwind 5' {mRNA} secondary structure. Recombinant Pdcd4 specifically inhibited the helicase activity of {eIF}4A and {eIF}4F. In vivo translation assays showed that Pdcd4 inhibited cap-dependent but not internal ribosome entry site ({IRES})-dependent translation. In contrast, Pdcd4(D418A), a mutant inactivated for binding to {eIF}4A, failed to inhibit cap-dependent or {IRES}-dependent translation or {AP}-1 transactivation. Recombinant Pdcd4 prevented {eIF}4A from binding to the C-terminal region of {eIF}4G (amino acids 1040 to 1560) but not to the middle region of {eIF}4G(amino acids 635 to 1039). In addition, both Pdcd4 and Pdcd4(D418A) bound to the middle region of {eIF}4G. The mechanism by which Pdcd4 inhibits translation thus appears to involve inhibition of {eIF}4A helicase, interference with {eIF}4A association-dissociation from {eIF}4G, and inhibition of {eIF}4A binding to the C-terminal domain of {eIF}4G. Pdcd4 binding to {eIF}4A is linked to its transformation-suppressing activity, as Pdcd4-{eIF}4A binding and consequent inhibition of translation are required for Pdcd4 transrepression of {AP}-1.},

Both pathways engage the mechanistic target of rapamycin ({mTOR}) to regulate a variety of components of the translational machinery.

	abstract = {There is accumulating evidence that mammalian target of rapamycin ({mTOR})-activated pathways play important roles in cell growth and survival of {BCR}-{ABL}-transformed cells. We have previously shown that the {mTOR}/p70 S6 kinase (p70 S6K) pathway is constitutively activated in {BCR}-{ABL} transformed cells and that inhibition of {BCR}-{ABL} kinase activity by imatinib mesylate abrogates such activation. We now provide evidence for the existence of a novel regulatory mechanism by which {BCR}-{ABL} promotes cell proliferation, involving p70 S6K-mediated suppression of expression of programmed cell death 4 ({PDCD}4), a tumor suppressor protein that acts as an inhibitor of cap-dependent translation by blocking the translation initiation factor {eIF}4A. Our data also establish that second generation {BCR}-{ABL} kinase inhibitors block activation of p70 S6K and downstream engagement of the S6 ribosomal protein in {BCR}-{ABL} transformed cells. Moreover, {PDCD}4 protein expression is up-regulated by inhibition of the {BCR}-{ABL} kinase in K562 cells and {BaF}3/{BCR}-{ABL} transfectants, suggesting a mechanism for the generation of the proapoptotic effects of such inhibitors. Knockdown of {PDCD}4 expression results in reversal of the suppressive effects of nilotinib and imatinib mesylate on leukemic progenitor colony formation, suggesting an important role for this protein in the generation of antileukemic responses. Altogether, our studies identify a novel mechanism by which {BCR}-{ABL} may promote leukemic cell growth, involving sequential engagement of the {mTOR}/p70 S6K pathway and downstream suppression of {PDCD}4 expression.},

The best studied targets of {mTORC}1 in translation are the eukaryotic initiation factor-binding protein 1 (4E-{BP}1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). In this study, we identify the La-related protein 1 ({LARP}1) as a key novel target of {mTORC}1 with a fundamental role in terminal oligopyrimidine ({TOP}) {mRNA} translation. Recent genome-wide studies indicate that {TOP} and {TOP}-like {mRNAs} compose a large portion of the {mTORC}1 translatome, but the mechanism by which {mTORC}1 controls {TOP} {mRNA} translation is incompletely understood. Here, we report that {LARP}1 functions as a key repressor of {TOP} {mRNA} translation downstream of {mTORC}1. Our data show the following: (i) {LARP}1 associates with {mTORC}1 via {RAPTOR}; (ii) {LARP}1 interacts with {TOP} {mRNAs} in an {mTORC}1-dependent manner; (iii) {LARP}1 binds the 5'{TOP} motif to repress {TOP} {mRNA} translation; and (iv) {LARP}1 competes with the eukaryotic initiation factor ({eIF}) 4G for {TOP} {mRNA} binding. Importantly, from a drug resistance standpoint, our data also show that reducing {LARP}1 protein levels by {RNA} interference attenuates the inhibitory effect of rapamycin, Torin1, and amino acid deprivation on {TOP} {mRNA} translation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that {LARP}1 functions as an important repressor of {TOP} {mRNA} translation downstream of {mTORC}1.},

Two complexes of {mTOR} have been identified: complex 1, consisting of {mTOR}-Raptor (regulatory associated protein of {mTOR})-{mLST}8 (termed {mTORC}1), and complex 2, comprising {mTOR}-Rictor (rapamycininsensitive companion of {mTOR})-{mLST}8-Sin1 (termed {mTORC}2). {mTORC}1 phosphorylates the p70 ribosomal S6K (S6 kinase) at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), whereas {mTORC}2 phosphorylates {PKB} (protein kinase B) at its hydrophobic motif (Ser473). In the present study, we report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1 (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are components of {mTORC}2. We demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Protor-1 or Protor-2 results in the co-immunoprecipitation of other {mTORC}2 subunits, but not Raptor, a specific component of {mTORC}1. We show that detergents such as Triton X-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate {mTOR} and {mLST}8 from a complex of Protor-1, Sin1 and Rictor. We also provide evidence that Rictor regulates the expression of Protor-1, and that Protor-1 is not required for the assembly of other {mTORC}2 subunits into a complex. Protor-1 is a novel Rictor-binding subunit of {mTORC}2, but further work is required to establish its role.},

How {TC} and {eIF}4F assembly are coordinated, however, remains largely unknown. We show that {mTOR} suppresses translation of {mRNAs} activated under short-term stress wherein {TC} recycling is attenuated by {eIF}2α phosphorylation. During acute nutrient or growth factor stimulation, {mTORC}1 induces {eIF}2β phosphorylation and recruitment of {NCK}1 to {eIF}2, decreases {eIF}2α phosphorylation and bolsters {TC} recycling. Accordingly, {eIF}2β mediates the effect of {mTORC}1 on protein synthesis and proliferation. In addition, we demonstrate a formerly undocumented role for {CK}2 in regulation of translation initiation, whereby {CK}2 stimulates phosphorylation of {eIF}2β and simultaneously bolsters {eIF}4F complex assembly via the {mTORC}1/4E-{BP} pathway. These findings imply a previously unrecognized mode of translation regulation, whereby {mTORC}1 and {CK}2 coordinate {TC} and {eIF}4F complex assembly to stimulate cell proliferation. Ternary complex ({TC}) and {eIF}4F complex assembly are rate-limiting steps in translation initiation that are regulated by {eIF}2α phosphorylation and the {mTOR}/4E-{BP} pathway.

Considering that {mRNA} translation is an energy demanding process, cancer cells must produce sufficient {ATP} to meet energy demand of hyperactive translational machinery. In recent years, the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin ({mTOR}) emerged as a central regulatory node which coordinates energy consumption by the translation apparatus and {ATP} production in mitochondria. Aberrant {mTOR} signaling underpins the vast majority of cancers whereby increased {mTOR} activity is thought to be a major determinant of both malignant translatomes and metabolomes. Nonetheless, the role of {mTOR} and other related signaling nodes (e.g. {AMPK}) in orchestrating protein synthesis and cancer energetics is only recently being unraveled. In this review, we discuss recent findings that provide insights into the molecular underpinnings of coordination of translational and metabolic programs of cancer cells, and potential strategies to translate these findings into clinical treatments.},

	abstract = {Control of translation allows for the production of stoichiometric levels of each protein in the cell. Attaining such a level of fine-tuned regulation of protein production requires the coordinated temporal and spatial control of numerous cellular signalling cascades impinging on the various components of the translational machinery. Foremost among these is the {mTOR} signalling pathway. The {mTOR} pathway regulates both the initiation and elongation steps of protein synthesis through the phosphorylation of numerous translation factors, while simultaneously ensuring adequate folding of nascent polypeptides through co-translational degradation of misfolded proteins. Perhaps most remarkably, {mTOR} is also a key regulator of the synthesis of ribosomal proteins and translation factors themselves. Two seminal studies have recently shown in translatome analysis that the {mTOR} pathway preferentially regulates the translation of {mRNAs} encoding ribosomal proteins and translation factors. Therefore, the role of the {mTOR} pathway in the control of protein synthesis extends far beyond immediate translational control. By controlling ribosome production (and ultimately ribosome availability), {mTOR} is a master long-term controller of protein synthesis. Herein, we review the literature spanning the early discoveries of {mTOR} on translation to the latest advances in our understanding of how the {mTOR} pathway controls the synthesis of ribosomal proteins.},

In this study, we find that {mTORC}2 can colocalize with actively translating ribosomes and can stably interact with {rpL}23a, a large ribosomal subunit protein present at the tunnel exit. Exclusively during translation of Akt, {mTORC}2 mediates phosphorylation of the nascent polypeptide at the turn motif ({TM}) site, Thr450, to avoid cotranslational Akt ubiquitination. Constitutive {TM} phosphorylation occurs because the {TM} site is accessible, whereas the hydrophobic motif (Ser473) site is concealed in the ribosomal tunnel.

Studies over the past decade have uncovered a number of additional S6K1 substrates, revealing multiple levels at which the {mTORC}1-S6K1 axis regulates cell physiology. The results thus far indicate that the {mTORC}1-S6K1 axis controls fundamental cellular processes, including transcription, translation, protein and lipid synthesis, cell growth/size and cell metabolism. In the present review we summarize the regulation of S6Ks, their cellular substrates and functions, and their integration within rapidly expanding {mTOR} (mammalian {TOR}) signalling networks. Although our understanding of the role of {mTORC}1-S6K1 signalling in physiology remains in its infancy, evidence indicates that this signalling axis controls, at least in part, glucose homoeostasis, insulin sensitivity, adipocyte metabolism, body mass and energy balance, tissue and organ size, learning, memory and aging. As dysregulation of this signalling axis contributes to diverse disease states, improved understanding of S6K regulation and function within {mTOR} signalling networks may enable the development of novel therapeutics.},

Here, we uncover the role of the phytohormone auxin in {TOR} signalling activation and reinitiation after upstream open reading frame ({uORF}) translation, which in plants is dependent on translation initiation factor {eIF}3h. We show that auxin triggers {TOR} activation followed by S6K1 phosphorylation at T449 and efficient loading of {uORF}-{mRNAs} onto polysomes in a manner sensitive to the {TOR} inhibitor Torin-1. Torin-1 mediates recruitment of inactive S6K1 to polysomes, while auxin triggers S6K1 dissociation and recruitment of activated {TOR} instead. A putative target of {TOR}/S6K1-{eIF}3h-is phosphorylated and detected in polysomes in response to auxin. In {TOR}-deficient plants, polysomes were prebound by inactive S6K1, and loading of {uORF}-{mRNAs} and {eIF}3h was impaired. Transient expression of {eIF}3h-S178D in plant protoplasts specifically upregulates {uORF}-{mRNA} translation. We propose that {TOR} functions in polysomes to maintain the active S6K1 (and thus {eIF}3h) phosphorylation status that is critical for translation reinitiation.},

To help fill this gap in knowledge, we performed a quantitative proteomic screen to identify proteins that associate with the {mRNA} 5' cap in an {mTOR}-dependent manner. Using this approach, we identified many potential regulatory factors, including the putative {RNA}-binding protein {LARP}1 (La-related protein 1). Our results indicate that {LARP}1 associates with actively translating ribosomes via {PABP} and that {LARP}1 stimulates the translation of {mRNAs} containing a 5' terminal oligopyrimidine ({TOP}) motif, encoding for components of the translational machinery.

Control analysis was used to quantify the relative control over {ATP} production exerted by the individual groups of {ATP}-consuming reactions.

Control analysis also indicated that there was significant control over the rates of individual {ATP} consumers by energy supply. Each {ATP} consumer had strong control over its own rate but very little control over the rates of the other {ATP} consumers.},

While phosphorylation of {rpS}6 is dispensable for cancer formation, 4EBP-{eIF}4E exerts significant control over cap-dependent translation, cell growth, cancer initiation, and progression. This effect is mediated at least in part through 4EBP-dependent control of Mcl-1 expression, a key antiapoptotic protein. By using an active site inhibitor of {mTOR}, {PP}242, we show a marked therapeutic response in rapamycin-resistant tumors. The therapeutic benefit of {PP}242 is mediated through inhibition of {mTORC}1-dependent 4EBP-{eIF}4E hyperactivation. Thus, the 4EBP-{eIF}4E axis downstream of {mTOR} is a druggable mediator of translational control and Akt-mediated tumorigenesis that has important implications for the treatment of human cancers.},

They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list - reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment." Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

Members of the {LARP}1 family are found in most protists, fungi, plants, and animals. We review here evidence suggesting that {LARP}1 are key versatile messenger {RNA} ({mRNA})-binding proteins involved in regulating important biological processes such as gametogenesis, embryogenesis, sex determination, and cell division in animals, as well as acclimation to stress in yeasts and plants. {LARP}1 proteins perform all these essential tasks likely by binding to key {mRNAs} and regulating their stability and/or translation. In human, the impact of {LARP}1 over cell division and proliferation is potentially under the control of the {TORC}1 complex. We review data suggesting that {LARP}1 is a direct target of this master signaling hub. {TOR}-dependent {LARP}1 phosphorylation could specifically enhance the translation of {TOP} {mRNAs} providing a way to promote translation, growth, and proliferation. Consequently, {LARP}1 is found to be significantly upregulated in many malignant cell types. In plants, {LARP}1 was found to act as a cofactor of the heat-induced {mRNA} degradation process, an essential acclimation strategy leading to the degradation of more than 4500 {mRNAs} coding for growth and development housekeeping functions. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the {LARP}1 proteins (Slf1p and Sro9p) are important, among other things, for copper resistance and oxidative stress survival. {LARP}1 proteins are therefore emerging as critical ancient {mRNA}-binding factors that evolved common as well as specific targets and regulatory functions in all eukaryotic lineages.},

	abstract = {Purpose
Activating mutations in the phosphoinositide-3-kinase ({PI}3K)/{AKT}/{mTOR} pathway are present in the majority of breast cancers and therefore are a major focus of drug development and clinical trials. Pathway mutations have been proposed as predictive biomarkers for efficacy of {PI}3K-targeted therapies. However, the precise contribution of distinct {PI}3K pathway mutations to drug sensitivity is unknown.

Experimental Design
We describe the creation of a physiologic human luminal breast cancer cell line model to study the phenotype of these mutations using the {MCF}-7 cell line. We utilized somatic cell gene targeting to “correct” {PIK}3CA E545K mutant alleles in {MCF}-7 cells to wild type sequence. The {AKT}1 E17K hotspot mutation was knocked in on this wild type background.

Results
Loss of mutant {PIK}3CA dramatically reduced phosphorylation of {AKT} proteins and several known {AKT} targets, but other {AKT} target proteins and downstream effectors of {mTOR} were not affected. {PIK}3CA wild type cells exhibited reduced proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Knock-in of the {AKT}1 E17K hotspot mutation on this {PIK}3CA wild type background restored pathway signaling, proliferation, and tumor growth in vivo. {PIK}3CA, but not {AKT}1 mutation, increased sensitivity to the {PI}3K inhibitor {GDC}-0941 and the allosteric {AKT} inhibitor {MK}-2206.

Conclusions
{AKT}1 E17K is a bona fide oncogene in a human luminal breast cancer context. Distinct {PI}3K pathway mutations confer differential sensitivity to drugs targeting the pathway at different points and by distinct mechanisms. These findings have implications for the use of tumor genome sequencing to assign patients to targeted therapies.},

This resulted in tumor growth delay in eight different human cancer xenograft models with various {PI}3K pathway abnormalities. Decreased phosphorylation of {AKT} was observed in U87MG gliomas, consistent with drug levels achieved.

The aim of this study was to determine the level of expression of {eIF}4E and {eIF}4E-binding protein 1 (4E-{BP}1) in esophageal cancer.
{DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}: Tumor and normal adjacent tissue samples (as controls) were obtained from 99 patients with esophageal cancer. {eIF}4E and 4E-{BP}1 levels were determined by using Western blot analysis. {eIF}4E was purified by affinity chromatography using m(7){GTP}-sepharose, and the levels of 4E-{BP}1 bound to {eIF}4E were determined.
{RESULTS}: : In cancerous esophageal tissues, {eIF}4E level was elevated by a mean of 12.59 +/- 1.66-fold, and 4E-{BP}1 was elevated by a mean of 15.76 +/- 2.45-fold when compared to normal adjacent tissues. Both {eIF}4E and 4E-{BP}1 expressions were higher in cancerous compared to noncancerous esophageal tissues.
{CONCLUSIONS}: A higher expression of {eIF}4E was correlated with advanced stages. The inverse relationship found between the increases in 4E-{BP}1 levels observed in esophagus tumors and lymph node involvement would support the hypothesis that the overexpression of {eIF}4E can be involved in tumorigenesis and a possible role of 4E-{BP}1 as a prognostic factor in esophageal cancer.},

However, {MM} recurrences in bortezomib-treated patients are invariable. We have shown that {ER} stress signaling can also induce growth arrest and survival in cancer cells. Thus, we hypothesized that bortezomib therapy could induce quiescence and survival of residual {MM} cells, contributing to disease recurrence. Here, we report that in {MM} cells, proteasome inhibition with {MG}-132 or bortezomib results in a surviving cell fraction that enters a prolonged quiescent state (G0–G1 arrest). Mechanism analysis revealed that bortezomib-surviving quiescent cells attenuate {eIF}2α phosphorylation and induction of the {ER} stress proapoptotic gene {GADD}153. This occurs independently of the {eIF}2α upstream kinases {PERK}, {GCN}2, and {PKR}. In contrast, the prosurvival {ER}-chaperone {BiP}/Grp78 was persistently induced. The bortezomib-surviving quiescent fraction could be eradicated by a simultaneous or sequential combination therapy with salubrinal, an inhibitor of {GADD}34-{PP}1C phosphatase complex, and, in consequence, {eIF}2α dephosphorylation. This effect was mimicked by expression of a phosphorylated mimetic {eIF}2α-S51D mutant. Our data indicate that bortezomib can induce growth arrest in therapy-surviving {MM} cells and that attenuation of {eIF}2α phosphorylation contributes to this survival. Most importantly, this survival mechanism can be blocked by inhibiting {eIF}2α dephosphorylation. Thus, strategies that maintain {eIF}2α in a hyperphosphorylated state may be a novel therapeutic approach to maximize bortezomib-induced apoptosis and reduce residual disease and recurrences in this type of cancer.},

Thus, we performed a comprehensive detection of terminal oligo-pyrimidine ({TOP}), which is one of the well-characterized cis-regulatory motifs for translational controls located immediately downstream of the transcriptional start sites of {mRNAs}. Utilizing our precise 5'-end information of the full-length {cDNAs}, we could screen 1645 candidate {TOP} genes by position specific matrix search. Among them, not only 75 out of 78 ribosomal protein genes but also eight previously identified non-ribosomal-protein {TOP} genes were included. We further experimentally validated the translational activities of 83 {TOP} candidate genes. Clear translational regulations exerted on the stimulation of 12-O-tetradecanoyl-1-phorbol-13-acetate for at least 41 of them was observed, indicating that there should be a few hundreds of human genes which are subjected to regulation at translation levels via {TOPs}.

Unfortunately expense and limited specimen availability often lead to studies with small sample sizes. This makes accurate estimation of variability difficult, since variance estimates made on a gene by gene basis will have few degrees of freedom, and the assumption that all genes share equal variance is unlikely to be true.
{RESULTS}: We propose a model by which the within gene variances are drawn from an inverse gamma distribution, whose parameters are estimated across all genes. This results in a test statistic that is a minor variation of those used in standard linear models. We demonstrate that the model assumptions are valid on experimental data, and that the model has more power than standard tests to pick up large changes in expression, while not increasing the rate of false positives.

The application of this technique to permit detection of otherwise obscured effects for both larger and smaller samples is exemplified utilizing data from two studies in which subjects were assessed on multiple different dates. These included a study of the association of depression with in vitro immune measures in 296 adolescents and a longitudinal study of 20 spouses of patients admitted to a cardiac intensive care unit studied together with 20 matched controls. {APV} was most useful in analyses of mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation assays, which had considerable day to day variability.

Using end-enriched {RNA}-sequencing (Rend-seq) with single-nucleotide resolution, we found that many bacterial gene clusters encoding conserved pathways have undergone massive divergence in transcript abundance and architectures via remodeling of internal promoters and terminators. Remarkably, these evolutionary changes are compensated post-transcriptionally to maintain preferred stoichiometry of protein synthesis rates. Even more strikingly, in eukaryotic budding yeast, functionally analogous proteins that arose independently from bacterial counterparts also evolved to convergent in-pathway expression. The broad requirement for exact protein stoichiometries despite regulatory divergence provides an unexpected principle for building biological pathways both in nature and for synthetic activities.},

Here we have applied ribosome profiling--which measures both global {mRNA} levels and their translation rates--to two species of Saccharomyces yeast and their interspecific hybrid in order to assess the relative contributions of changes in {mRNA} abundance and translation to regulatory evolution. We report that both cis- and trans-acting regulatory divergence in translation are abundant, affecting at least 35\% of genes. The majority of translational divergence acts to buffer changes in {mRNA} abundance, suggesting a widespread role for stabilizing selection acting across regulatory levels. Nevertheless, we observe evidence of lineage-specific selection acting on several yeast functional modules, including instances of reinforcing selection acting at both levels of regulation. Finally, we also uncover multiple instances of stop-codon readthrough that are conserved between species. Our analysis reveals the underappreciated complexity of post-transcriptional regulatory divergence and indicates that partitioning the search for the locus of selection into the binary categories of "coding" versus "regulatory" may overlook a significant source of selection, acting at multiple regulatory levels along the path from genotype to phenotype.},

Here we used ribosome profiling to compare transcript abundance and translation efficiency in two closely related yeast species (S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus). By comparing translation regulatory divergence to interspecies differences in {mRNA} sequence features, we show that differences in transcript leaders and codon bias substantially contribute to divergent translation. Globally, we find that translation regulatory divergence often buffers species differences in {mRNA} abundance, such that ribosome occupancy is more conserved than transcript abundance. We used allele-specific ribosome profiling in interspecies hybrids to compare the relative contributions of cis- and trans-regulatory divergence to species differences in {mRNA} abundance and translation efficiency. The mode of gene regulatory divergence differs for these processes, as trans-regulatory changes play a greater role in divergent {mRNA} abundance than in divergent translation efficiency. Strikingly, most genes with aberrant transcript abundance in F1 hybrids (either over- or underexpressed compared to both parent species) did not exhibit aberrant ribosome occupancy. Our results show that interspecies differences in translation contribute substantially to the evolution of gene expression. Compensatory differences in transcript abundance and translation efficiency may increase the robustness of gene regulation.},

In this article, we present the first systems level study of the characteristics of this feedback controller, using an integrated experimental and modeling approach. Quantitative analysis of mutant yeast strains in which polyamine synthesis and interconversion were blocked revealed marked variations in frameshift responses to the different polyamines. Putrescine and spermine, but not spermidine, showed evidence of co-operative stimulation of frameshifting and the existence of multiple ribosome binding sites. Combinatorial polyamine treatments showed polyamines compete for binding to common ribosome sites. Using concepts from enzyme kinetics and control engineering, a mathematical model of the translational controller was developed to describe these complex ribosomal responses to combinatorial polyamine effects. Each one of a range of model predictions was successfully validated against experimental frameshift frequencies measured in S-adenosylmethionine-decarboxylase and antizyme mutants, as well as in the wild-type genetic background.},

Recent efforts to catalog these {mTOR}-sensitive {mRNAs} resulted in conflicting results. Whereas ribosome-profiling almost exclusively identified 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine ({TOP}) {mRNAs} as {mTOR}-sensitive, polysome-profiling suggested that {mTOR} also regulates translation of non-{TOP} {mRNAs}. This inconsistency was explained by analytical and technical biases limiting the efficiency of ribosome-profiling in detecting {mRNAs} showing differential translation. Moreover, genome-wide characterization of 5'{UTRs} of non-{TOP} {mTOR}-sensitive {mRNAs} revealed 2 subsets of transcripts which differ in their requirement for translation initiation factors and biologic functions.

However, {mTOR}-sensitive translatomes commonly include {mRNAs} with a 5’ terminal oligopyrimidine tract ({TOP}), such as those encoding ribosomal proteins, but not {ISGs}. Because these translatomes were obtained under conditions when {ISG} expression is not induced, we examined the {mTOR}-sensitive translatome in human {WISH} cells stimulated with {IFN} β. The {mTOR} inhibitor Torin1 resulted in a repression of global protein synthesis, including that of {ISG} products, and translation of all but 3 {ISG} {mRNAs} ({TLR}3, {NT}5C3A, and {RNF}19B) was not selectively more sensitive to {mTOR} inhibition. Detailed studies of {NT}5C3A revealed an {IFN}-induced change in transcription start site resulting in a switch from a non-{TOP} to a {TOP}-like transcript variant and {mTOR} sensitive translation. Thus, we show that, in the cell model used, translation of the vast majority of {ISG} {mRNAs} is not selectively sensitive to {mTOR} activity and describe an uncharacterized mechanism wherein the 5’-{UTR} of an {mRNA} is altered in response to a cytokine, resulting in a shift from {mTOR}-insensitive to {mTOR}-sensitive translation.},

Because this technique reports on the exact position of ribosomes, it also revealed the presence of ribosomes on upstream open reading frames and demonstrated that ribosome density was higher near the beginning of protein-coding genes. Here, we describe nuclease digestion conditions that produce uniform {\textasciitilde}28 nucleotide (nt) protected fragments of {mRNA} templates that indicate the exact position of translating ribosomes. We also give a protocol for converting these {RNA} fragments into a {DNA} library that can be sequenced using the Illumina Genome Analyzer. Unbiased conversion of anonymous, small {RNAs} into a sequencing library is challenging, and we discuss standards that played a key role in optimizing library generation.

	abstract = {{mRNA} translation plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression and represents the most energy consuming process in mammalian cells. Accordingly, dysregulation of {mRNA} translation is considered to play a major role in a variety of pathological states including cancer. Ribosomes also host chaperones, which facilitate folding of nascent polypeptides, thereby modulating function and stability of newly synthesized polypeptides. In addition, emerging data indicate that ribosomes serve as a platform for a repertoire of signaling molecules, which are implicated in a variety of post-translational modifications of newly synthesized polypeptides as they emerge from the ribosome, and/or components of translational machinery. Herein, a well-established method of ribosome fractionation using sucrose density gradient centrifugation is described. In conjunction with the in-house developed "anota" algorithm this method allows direct determination of differential translation of individual {mRNAs} on a genome-wide scale. Moreover, this versatile protocol can be used for a variety of biochemical studies aiming to dissect the function of ribosome-associated protein complexes, including those that play a central role in folding and degradation of newly synthesized polypeptides.},

Furthermore, we develop a clinically relevant {ATP} site inhibitor of {mTOR}, {INK}128, which reprograms this gene expression signature with therapeutic benefit for prostate cancer metastasis, for which there is presently no cure.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Angiomyolipomas in patients with the tuberous sclerosis complex or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis are associated with mutations in tuberous sclerosis genes resulting in constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin ({mTOR}). The drug sirolimus suppresses {mTOR} signaling.
{METHODS}: We conducted a 24-month, nonrandomized, open-label trial to determine whether sirolimus reduces the angiomyolipoma volume in patients with the tuberous sclerosis complex or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Sirolimus was administered for the first 12 months only. Serial magnetic resonance imaging of angiomyolipomas and brain lesions, computed tomography of lung cysts, and pulmonary-function tests were performed.
{RESULTS}: Of the 25 patients enrolled, 20 completed the 12-month evaluation, and 18 completed the 24-month evaluation. The mean (+/-{SD}) angiomyolipoma volume at 12 months was 53.2+/-26.6\% of the baseline value (P{\textless}0.001) and at 24 months was 85.9+/-28.5\% of the baseline value (P=0.005). At 24 months, five patients had a persistent reduction in the angiomyolipoma volume of 30\% or more. During the period of sirolimus therapy, among patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis, the mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second ({FEV}1) increased by 118+/-330 ml (P=0.06), the forced vital capacity ({FVC}) increased by 390+/-570 ml (P{\textless}0.001), and the residual volume decreased by 439+/-493 ml (P=0.02), as compared with baseline values. One year after sirolimus was discontinued, the {FEV}1 was 62+/-411 ml above the baseline value, the {FVC} was 346+/-712 ml above the baseline value, and the residual volume was 333+/-570 ml below the baseline value; cerebral lesions were unchanged. Five patients had six serious adverse events while receiving sirolimus, including diarrhea, pyelonephritis, stomatitis, and respiratory infections.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Angiomyolipomas regressed somewhat during sirolimus therapy but tended to increase in volume after the therapy was stopped. Some patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis had improvement in spirometric measurements and gas trapping that persisted after treatment. Suppression of {mTOR} signaling might constitute an ameliorative treatment in patients with the tuberous sclerosis complex or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

Several differential expression screens have demonstrated altered levels of {eIF}4E, along with several other translation initiation factors, in response to alterations of c-myc levels. The potential for {eIF}4E and other translational control elements to mediate myc's transforming functions is particularly important because {eIF}4E is itself a known oncogenic factor.

{METHODS}: Western blotting was performed to quantify the {elF}4E protein expression in the normal human liver cell line L02 and the hepatoma cell lines Hep3B, {HepG}2, and Huh7. Forty-six hepatocellular carcinoma samples with complete clinical data were obtained from Changzheng Hospital during the period of December 2008 to July 2009. The expression of {eIF}4E in the tumor samples and their adjacent tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between the test results and hepatocellular carcinoma ({HCC}) prognosis was statistically analysed by using a {COX} proportional hazard model.
{RESULTS}: Western blotting analysis showed that there were distinct {eIF}4E protein bands in all three of the hepatoma cell lines. In particular, the {HepG}2 cell line had the highest level of {eIF}4E protein expression. The L02 cell group had a low {eIF}4E expression. Immunohistochemical assay showed that there were 32 cases in which the tumour tissue expression was higher than their adjacent tissues, accounting for 69.57\%. There were also 14 cases in which the tumour tissue expression was lower or no significant difference was found, accounting for 30.43\%. {COX} proportional hazards model analysis showed that {HCC} prognosis was related to the depth of invasion, the overexpression of {eIF}4E and p53, possibly as independent {HCC} prognostic predictors.

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}: The objective of this study is to determine if high eukaryotic initiation factor 4E ({eIF}4E) overexpression (sevenfold elevation or more over benign breast tissue) is associated with a worse clinical outcome. {SUMMARY} {BACKGROUND} {DATA}: Dysregulation of cellular functions by selective overexpression of specific proteins can lead to malignant transformation. The overexpression of {eIF}4E preferentially increases translation of {mRNAs} with long, G-C rich 5'-untranslated regions. Selective gene products, such as tumor neoangiogenic factors, ornithine decarboxylase, and cyclin D1, are upregulated. {METHODS}: One hundred fourteen breast specimens were analyzed and {eIF}4E overexpression was quantified by Western blot analysis. Quantification for {eIF}4E protein level was accomplished using a rabbit anti-{eIF}4E antibody and colorimetric development of Western blots using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. The blots were scanned and analyzed by densitometry. Treatment, pathologic, and clinical outcome data variables were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed to determine if {eIF}4E overexpression is associated with breast cancer clinical outcome. {RESULTS}: In the 55 benign specimens, the mean {eIF}4E expression was 1.1+/-0.4 fold (mean +/- standard deviation). All 59 malignant breast carcinoma specimens were noted to have {eIF}4E overexpression (range, 1.9-fold to 30.6-fold), with a mean overexpression of 10.8+/-6.3-fold. The mean level of {eIF}4E expression in malignant specimens was higher than benign specimens (p {\textless} 0.05, unpaired t test). The degree of {eIF}4E overexpression appears to be independent of T and N stage. In the 21 patients with {eIF}4E overexpression of less than sevenfold, there was one cancer recurrence but no cancer-related deaths. In the 38 patients with high {eIF}4E overexpression (sevenfold or more), 14 patients had breast cancer recurrences (p = 0.03, log rank test), of whom 11 have died from the disease (p = 0.04, log rank test). The average follow-up interval in this study was 40 months. {CONCLUSIONS}: Patients with stage I to {III} breast cancer and high {eIF}4E overexpression had a higher rate of cancer recurrence and a higher rate of cancer-related death when compared to similar-stage breast cancer patients with low {eIF}4E overexpression. Therefore, {eIF}4E protein overexpression may be of prognostic value in stage I to {III} breast carcinoma.},

By immunohistochemical analyses of 148 tissues from 89 prostate cancer patients, we now show that both {eIF}4E expression and 4E-{BP}1 phosphorylation (p4E-{BP}1) are increased significantly, particularly in advanced prostate cancer versus benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues. Further, increased {eIF}4E and p4E-{BP}1 levels are significantly related to reduced patient survival, whereas uniform 4E-{BP}1 expression is significantly related to better patient survival. Both immunohistochemistry and Western blotting reveal that elevated {eIF}4E and p4E-{BP}1 are evident in the same prostate cancer tissues. In two distinct prostate cancer cell models, the progression to androgen independence also involves increased {eIF}4E activation. In these prostate cancer cells, reducing {eIF}4E expression with an {eIF}4E-specific antisense oligonucleotide currently in phase I clinical trials robustly induces apoptosis, regardless of cell cycle phase, and reduces expression of the {eIF}4E-regulated proteins {BCL}-2 and c-myc. Collectively, these data implicate {eIF}4E activation in prostate cancer and suggest that targeting {eIF}4E may be attractive for prostate cancer therapy.},

	abstract = {The link between perturbations in translational control and cancer etiology is becoming a primary focus in cancer research. It has now been established that genetic alterations in several components of the translational apparatus underlie spontaneous cancers as well as an entire class of inherited syndromes known as "ribosomopathies" associated with increased cancer susceptibility. These discoveries have illuminated the importance of deregulations in translational control to very specific cellular processes that contribute to cancer etiology. In addition, a growing body of evidence supports the view that deregulation of translational control is a common mechanism by which diverse oncogenic pathways promote cellular transformation and tumor development. Indeed, activation of these key oncogenic pathways induces rapid and dramatic translational reprogramming both by increasing overall protein synthesis and by modulating specific {mRNA} networks. These translational changes promote cellular transformation, impacting almost every phase of tumor development. This paradigm represents a new frontier in the multihit model of cancer formation and offers significant promise for innovative cancer therapies. Current research, in conjunction with cutting edge technologies, will further enable us to explore novel mechanisms of translational control, functionally identify translationally controlled {mRNA} groups, and unravel their impact on cellular transformation and tumorigenesis.},

In order to characterize the genetic landscape of this heterogeneous disorder, we recruited a cohort of 472 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of {DBA} and performed whole-exome sequencing ({WES}). We identified relevant rare and predicted damaging mutations for 78\% of individuals. The majority of mutations were singletons, absent from population databases, predicted to cause loss of function, and located in 1 of 19 previously reported ribosomal protein ({RP})-encoding genes. Using exon coverage estimates, we identified and validated 31 deletions in {RP} genes. We also observed an enrichment for extended splice site mutations and validated their diverse effects using {RNA} sequencing in cell lines obtained from individuals with {DBA}. Leveraging the size of our cohort, we observed robust genotype-phenotype associations with congenital abnormalities and treatment outcomes. We further identified rare mutations in seven previously unreported {RP} genes that may cause {DBA}, as well as several distinct disorders that appear to phenocopy {DBA}, including nine individuals with biallelic {CECR}1 mutations that result in deficiency of {ADA}2. However, no new genes were identified at exome-wide significance, suggesting that there are no unidentified genes containing mutations readily identified by {WES} that explain {\textgreater}5\% of {DBA}-affected case subjects. Overall, this report should inform not only clinical practice for {DBA}-affected individuals, but also the design and analysis of rare variant studies for heterogeneous Mendelian disorders.},

Using a reconstituted mammalian in vitro translation system, we show that {PABP} directly stimulates translation termination. {PABP} increases the efficiency of translation termination by recruitment of {eRF}3a and {eRF}1 to the ribosome. {PABP}'s function in translation termination depends on its C-terminal domain and its interaction with the N-terminus of {eRF}3a. Interestingly, we discover that full-length {eRF}3a exerts a different mode of function compared to its truncated form {eRF}3c, which lacks the N-terminal domain. Pre-association of {eRF}3a, but not of {eRF}3c, with pre-termination complexes ({preTCs}) significantly increases the efficiency of peptidyl–{tRNA} hydrolysis by {eRF}1. This implicates new, additional interactions of full-length {eRF}3a with the ribosomal {preTC}. Based on our findings, we suggest that {PABP} enhances the productive binding of the {eRF}1–{eRF}3 complex to the ribosome, via interactions with the N-terminal domain of {eRF}3a which itself has an active role in translation termination.},

Although many eukaryotes express two highly similar {eIF}4G isoforms, those in plants are highly divergent in size and sequence from one another and are referred to as {eIF}4G and {eIFiso}4G. Although the domain organization of {eIFiso}4G differs substantially from {eIF}4G orthologs in other species, the domain organization of plant {eIF}4G is largely unknown despite the fact that it is more similar in size and sequence to {eIF}4G of other eukaryotes. In this study, we show that {eIF}4G differs from {eIFiso}4G in that it contains two distinct interaction domains for the poly(A) binding protein ({PABP}) and {eIF}4B but is similar to {eIFiso}4G in having two {eIF}4A interaction domains. {PABP} and {eIF}4B bind the same N-terminal region of {eIF}4G as they do to a region C-proximal to the {HEAT}-1 domain in the middle domain of {eIF}4G, resulting in competitive binding between {eIF}4B and {PABP} to each site. {eIF}4G also differs from {eIFiso}4G in that no competitive binding was observed between {PABP} and {eIF}4A or between {eIF}4B and {eIF}4A to its {HEAT}-1-containing region.

Similar to the observations in Xenopus and mouse, human {EPAB} is the predominant poly(A) binding protein in immature (germinal vesicle) and mature (metaphase {II}) oocytes, and it is replaced by {PABPC}1 following {ZGA}, which occurs at 4- to 8-cell stage in human.

	abstract = {Gene expression during oocyte maturation, fertilization, and early embryo development until zygotic gene activation is regulated mainly by translational activation of maternally derived {mRNAs}. This process requires the presence of a poly(A)-binding protein. However, the cytoplasmic somatic cell poly(A)-binding protein ({PABP}1) is not expressed until later in embryogenesis. We recently identified an embryonic poly(A)-binding protein ({ePAB}) in Xenopus. {ePAB} is the predominant cytoplasmic {PABP} in Xenopus oocytes and early embryos and prevents deadenylation of {mRNAs}, suggesting its importance in the regulation of gene expression during early Xenopus development. Here we report the identification of the mouse ortholog of Xenopus {ePAB}. The mouse {ePAB} gene on chromosome 2 contains 14 exons that specify an alternatively spliced {mRNA} encoding a protein of 608 or 561 aa with ≈65\% identity to Xenopus {ePAB}. Mouse {ePAB} {mRNA} is expressed in ovaries and testis but not in somatic tissues. In situ hybridization localizes {ePAB} {RNA} to oocytes and confirms its absence from surrounding somatic cells in the mouse ovary. During early development, mouse {ePAB} is expressed in prophase I and metaphase {II} oocytes and one-cell and two-cell embryos and then becomes undetectable in four-or-more-cell embryos. In contrast, {PABP}1 {mRNA} expression is minimal in oocytes and early embryos until the eight-cell stage when it increases, becoming predominant at the blastocyst stage. The expression of mouse {ePAB} before zygotic gene activation argues for its importance in translational activation of maternally derived {mRNAs} during mammalian oocyte and early preimplantation embryo development.},

Thus, transcriptional induction and translational repression combine to form a negative feedback loop to control Cpeb4 protein levels within a specific range that is required for terminal erythropoiesis.

	doi = {10.3389/fphys.2018.00910},
	abstract = {Control of gene expression in erythropoiesis has to respond to signals that may emerge from intracellular processes or environmental factors. Control of {mRNA} translation allows for relatively rapid modulation of protein synthesis from the existing transcriptome. For instance, the protein synthesis rate needs to be reduced when reactive oxygen species or unfolded proteins accumulate in the cells, but also when iron supply is low or when growth factors are lacking in the environment. In addition, regulation of {mRNA} translation can be important as an additional layer of control on top of gene transcription, in which {RNA} binding proteins ({RBPs}) can modify translation of a set of transcripts to the cell's actual protein requirement. The 5' and 3' untranslated regions of {mRNA} (5'{UTR}, 3'{UTR}) contain binding sites for general and sequence specific translation factors. They also contain secondary structures that may hamper scanning of the 5'{UTR} by translation complexes or may help to recruit translation factors. In addition, the term 5'{UTR} is not fully correct because many transcripts contain small open reading frames in their 5'{UTR} that are translated and contribute to regulation of {mRNA} translation. It is becoming increasingly clear that the transcriptome only partly predicts the proteome. The aim of this review is (i) to summarize how the availability of general translation initiation factors can selectively regulate transcripts because the 5'{UTR} contains secondary structures or short translated sequences, (ii) to discuss mechanisms that control the length of the {mRNA} poly(A) tail in relation to {mRNA} translation, and (iii) to give examples of sequence specific {RBPs} and their targets. We focused on transcripts and {RBPs} required for erythropoiesis. Whereas differentiation of erythroblasts to erythrocytes is orchestrated by erythroid transcription factors, the production of erythrocytes needs to respond to the availability of growth factors and nutrients, particularly the availability of iron.},

Relative to {mRNAs} which were polyadenylated, we found that nonpolyadenylated [poly(A)-]{mRNAs} had a reduced translational capacity which was not due to an increase in their decay rates, but was attributable to a reduction in their efficiency of recruitment into polysomes. The defect in poly(A)- {mRNAs} affected a late step in translational initiation, was distinct from the phenotype associated with cap-deficient {mRNAs}, and resulted in a reduced ability to form 80S initiation complexes.

	abstract = {{TOP} {mRNAs} are vertebrate transcripts which contain a 5′ terminal oligopyrimidine tract (5′ {TOP}), encode for ribosomal proteins and elongation factors 1α and 2, and are candidates for growth-dependent translational control mediated through their 5′ {TOP}. In the present study we show that elongation factor 2 ({EF}2) {mRNA} is translationally regulated in a growth-dependent manner in cells of hematopoietic origin, but not in any of three different non-hematopoietic cell lines studied. Human β1-tubulin {mRNA} is a new member of the family which contains all the hallmarks of a typical {TOP} {mRNA}, yet its translation is refractory to growth arrest of any of the examined cell lines. Transfection experiments indicate that the first 29 and 53 nucleotides of the {mRNAs} encoding {EF}2 and β1-tubulin, respectively, contain all the translational cis -regulatory elements sufficient for ubiquitously conferring growth-dependent translational control on a reporter {mRNA}. These results suggest that the distinct translational regulation of {TOP} {mRNAs} reflects downstream sequences which can override the regulatory features of the 5′ {TOP} in a cell type-specific manner. This notion is further supported by the fact that mutations within the region immediately downstream of the 5′ {TOP} of {rpS}16 {mRNA} confer onto the resulting transcripts growth-dependent translational control with a cell type specificity similar to that displayed by {EF}2 {mRNA}.},

In mammalian cells, this effect is achieved in part through a co-ordinated inhibition of {RP} (ribosomal protein) synthesis. More specifically, translation initiation on {RP} {mRNAs} is inhibited. Translational regulation of {RP} synthesis is dependent on cis-elements within the 5′-{UTRs} (5′-untranslated regions) of the {RP} {mRNAs}. In particular, a highly conserved 5′-{TOP} (5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract) appears to play a key role in the regulation of {RP} {mRNA} translation.

However, some transcripts are translated in a cap-independent manner through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we show that {mRNAs} containing N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) in their 5' {UTR} can be translated in a cap-independent manner. A single 5' {UTR} m(6)A directly binds eukaryotic initiation factor 3 ({eIF}3), which is sufficient to recruit the 43S complex to initiate translation in the absence of the cap-binding factor {eIF}4E. Inhibition of adenosine methylation selectively reduces translation of {mRNAs} containing 5'{UTR} m(6)A. Additionally, increased m(6)A levels in the Hsp70 {mRNA} regulate its cap-independent translation following heat shock. Notably, we find that diverse cellular stresses induce a transcriptome-wide redistribution of m(6)A, resulting in increased numbers of {mRNAs} with 5' {UTR} m(6)A.

	abstract = {Iron regulatory protein 1 ({IRP}-1) binding to an iron-responsive element ({IRE}) located close to the cap structure of {mRNAs} represses translation by precluding the recruitment of the small ribosomal subunit to these {mRNAs}. This mechanism is position dependent; reporter {mRNAs} bearing {IREs} located further downstream exhibit diminished translational control in transfected mammalian cells. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we have recapitulated this position effect in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free translation system. We show that the recruitment of the 43S preinitiation complex to the {mRNA} is unaffected when {IRP}-1 is bound to a cap-distal {IRE}. Following 43S complex recruitment, the translation initiation apparatus appears to stall, before linearly progressing to the initiation codon. The slow passive dissociation rate of {IRP}-1 from the cap-distal {IRE} suggests that the mammalian translation apparatus plays an active role in overcoming the cap-distal {IRE}–{IRP}-1 complex. In contrast, cap-distal {IRE}–{IRP}-1 complexes efficiently repress translation in wheat germ and yeast translation extracts. Since inhibition occurs subsequent to 43S complex recruitment, an efficient arrest of productive scanning may represent a second mechanism by which {RNA}-protein interactions within the 5′ untranslated region of an {mRNA} can regulate translation. In contrast to initiating ribosomes, elongating ribosomes from mammal, plant, and yeast cells are unaffected by {IRE}–{IRP}-1 complexes positioned within the open reading frame. These data shed light on a characteristic aspect of the {IRE}-{IRP} regulatory system and uncover properties of the initiation and elongation translation apparatus of eukaryotic cells.},

	abstract = {The integrated stress response ({ISR}) is a cytoprotective pathway initiated upon phosphorylation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 ({eIF}2α) residue designated serine-51, which is critical for translational control in response to various stress conditions. Four {eIF}2α kinases, namely heme-regulated inhibitor ({HRI}), protein kinase R ({PKR}), {PKR}-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, ({PERK}) and general control non-depressible 2 ({GCN}2), have been identified thus far, and they are known to be activated by heme depletion, viral infection, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and amino acid starvation, respectively. Because {eIF}2α is phosphorylated under various stress conditions, the existence of an additional {eIF}2α kinase has been suggested. To validate the existence of the unidentified {eIF}2α kinase, we constructed an {eIF}2α kinase quadruple knockout cells (4KO cells) in which the four known {eIF}2α kinase genes were deleted using the {CRISPR}/Cas9-mediated genome editing. Phosphorylation of {eIF}2α was completely abolished in the 4KO cells by various stress stimulations. Our data suggests that the four known {eIF}2α kinases are sufficient for {ISR} and that there are no additional {eIF}2α kinases in vertebrates.},

This chronic {ISR} program is characterized by persistently elevated {uORF} {mRNA} translation and concurrent gene expression reprogramming, which permits simultaneous stress sensing and proteostasis. The program includes {PERK}-dependent switching to an {eIF}3-dependent translation initiation mechanism resulting in partial but not complete translational recovery, which, together with transcriptional reprogramming, selectively bolsters expression of proteins with {ER} functions. Coordination of transcriptional and translational reprogramming prevents {ER} dysfunction and inhibits “foamy cell” development, thus establishing a molecular basis for understanding human diseases associated with {ER} dysfunction.,

The core event in this pathway is the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha ({eIF}2α) by one of four members of the {eIF}2α kinase family, which leads to a decrease in global protein synthesis and the induction of selected genes, including the transcription factor {ATF}4, that together promote cellular recovery. The gene expression program activated by the {ISR} optimizes the cellular response to stress and is dependent on the cellular context, as well as on the nature and intensity of the stress stimuli. Although the {ISR} is primarily a pro-survival, homeostatic program, exposure to severe stress can drive signaling toward cell death. Here, we review current understanding of the {ISR} signaling and how it regulates cell fate under diverse types of stress.},

It binds the m7Gppp cap moiety and the adjacent 5'{TOP} motif of {TOP} {mRNAs}, thus impeding the assembly of the {eIF}4F complex on these transcripts. {mTORC}1 controls {TOP} {mRNA} translation via {LARP}1, but the details of the mechanism are unclear. Herein we elucidate the mechanism by which {mTORC}1 controls {LARP}1's translation repression activity. We demonstrate that {mTORC}1 phosphorylates {LARP}1 in vitro and in vivo, activities that are efficiently inhibited by rapamycin and torin1. We uncover 26 rapamycin-sensitive phospho-serine and -threonine residues on {LARP}1 that are distributed in 7 clusters. Our data show that phosphorylation of a cluster of residues located proximally to the m7Gppp cap-binding {DM}15 region is particularly sensitive to rapamycin and regulates both the {RNA}-binding and the translation inhibitory activities of {LARP}1. Our results unravel a new model of translation control in which the La module ({LaMod}) and {DM}15 region of {LARP}1, both of which can directly interact with {TOP} {mRNA}, are differentially regulated: the {LaMod} remains constitutively bound to {PABP} (irrespective of the activation status of {mTORC}1), while the C-terminal {DM}15 'pendular hook' engages the {TOP} {mRNA} 5'-end to repress translation, but only in conditions of {mTORC}1 inhibition.},

With the integration of matched {RNA} sequencing data, the translation efficiency ({TE}) of genes can be calculated to reveal translational regulation.

Current statistical methods to calculate differences in {TE} have low accuracy, cannot accommodate complex experimental designs or confounding factors, and do not categorize genes into buffered, intensified, or exclusively translationally regulated genes. This article outlines a method [referred to as {deltaTE} (Δ{TE}), standing for change in {TE}] to identify translationally regulated genes, which addresses the shortcomings of previous methods. In an extensive benchmarking analysis, Δ{TE} outperforms all methods tested. Furthermore, applying Δ{TE} on data from human primary cells allows detection of substantially more translationally regulated genes, providing a clearer understanding of translational regulation in pathogenic processes.

A detailed understanding of the control of gene expression at the level of messenger {RNA} translation is vital to elucidating a systems-level view of complex molecular programs in the cell. Establishing the degree to which such post-transcriptional regulation can mediate specific phenotypes is similarly critical to elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of diseases such as cancer. Recently, methods for massively parallel sequencing of ribosome-bound fragments of messenger {RNA} have begun to uncover genome-wide translational control at codon resolution. Despite its promise for deeply characterizing mammalian proteomes, few analytical methods exist for the comprehensive analysis of this paired {RNA} and ribosome data., Results: We describe the Babel framework, an analytical methodology for assessing the significance of changes in translational regulation within cells and between conditions. This approach facilitates the analysis of translation genome-wide while allowing statistically principled gene-level inference. Babel is based on an errors-in-variables regression model that uses the negative binomial distribution and draws inference using a parametric bootstrap approach. We demonstrate the operating characteristics of Babel on simulated data and use its gene-level inference to extend prior analyses significantly, discovering new translationally regulated modules under mammalian target of rapamycin ({mTOR}) pathway signaling control., Availability: The Babel framework is freely available as source code at http://taylorlab.ucsf.edu/software\_data.html., Contact:

	abstract = {Unlabelled: 
Translational control of gene expression has emerged as a major mechanism that regulates many biological processes and shows dysregulation in human diseases including cancer. When studying differential translation, levels of both actively translating {mRNAs} and total cytosolic {mRNAs} are obtained where the latter is used to correct for a possible contribution of differential cytosolic {mRNA} levels to the observed differential levels of actively translated {mRNAs}. We have recently shown that analysis of partial variance ({APV}) corrects for cytosolic {mRNA} levels more effectively than the commonly applied log ratio approach. {APV} provides a high degree of specificity and sensitivity for detecting biologically meaningful translation changes, especially when combined with a variance shrinkage method for estimating random error. Here we describe the anota (analysis of translational activity) R-package which implements {APV}, allows scrutiny of associated statistical assumptions and provides biologically motivated filters for analysis of genome wide datasets. Although the package was developed for analysis of differential translation in polysome microarray or ribosome-profiling datasets, any high-dimensional data that result in paired controls, such as {RNP} immunoprecipitation-microarray ({RIP}-{CHIP}) datasets, can be successfully analyzed with anota.

Whereas ribosome-profiling suggested that {MTOR} almost exclusively stimulates translation of the {TOP} (terminal oligopyrimidine motif) and {TOP}-like {mRNAs}, polysome-profiling indicated that {MTOR} also modulates translation of {mRNAs} without the 5′ {TOP} motif (non-{TOP} {mRNAs}). We demonstrate that in ribosome-profiling studies, detection of {MTOR}-dependent changes in non-{TOP} {mRNA} translation was obscured by low sensitivity and methodology biases. Transcription start site profiling using nano-cap analysis of gene expression ({nanoCAGE}) revealed that not only do many {MTOR}-sensitive {mRNAs} lack the 5′ {TOP} motif but that 5′ {UTR} features distinguish two functionally and translationally distinct subsets of {MTOR}-sensitive {mRNAs}: (1) {mRNAs} with short 5′ {UTRs} enriched for mitochondrial functions, which require {EIF}4E but are less {EIF}4A1-sensitive; and (2) long 5′ {UTR} {mRNAs} encoding proliferation- and survival-promoting proteins, which are both {EIF}4E- and {EIF}4A1-sensitive. Selective inhibition of translation of {mRNAs} harboring long 5′ {UTRs} via {EIF}4A1 suppression leads to sustained expression of proteins involved in respiration but concomitant loss of those protecting mitochondrial structural integrity, resulting in apoptosis. Conversely, simultaneous suppression of translation of both long and short 5′ {UTR} {mRNAs} by {MTOR} inhibitors results in metabolic dormancy and a predominantly cytostatic effect. Thus, 5′ {UTR} features define different modes of {MTOR}-sensitive translation of functionally distinct subsets of {mRNAs}, which may explain the diverse impact of {MTOR} and {EIF}4A inhibitors on neoplastic cells.},

	abstract = {Dysregulation of {mRNA} translation is a frequent feature of neoplasia. As the components of the translation machinery integrate almost all oncogenic signals, targeting the protein synthesis machinery holds promise for overcoming therapeutic issues associated with intra-tumour heterogeneity.Many translation initiation factors, including the subunits of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F ({eIF}4F) complex, were found to be dysregulated in various cancers. Increased {eIF}4E levels and/or availability for {eIF}4F assembly, as well as increased {eIF}4E phosphorylation, are observed in various malignancies and are associated with poor prognosis.Increased levels of the {eIF}4F complex render cancer cells resistant to chemotherapeutics (for example, doxorubicin) and targeted therapies (for example, mitogen-activated protein kinase ({MAPK}) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase–mammalian target of rapamycin ({PI}3K–{mTOR}) inhibitors), suggesting that the 'addiction' of drug-resistant cancer cells to {eIF}4F represents a vulnerability that could be clinically exploited.Allosteric inhibitors of {mTOR} complex 1 ({mTORC}1), such as rapamycin and rapamycin analogues, or rapalogues, are approved for treatment of various human cancers; however, their efficacy has been lower than expected. Active-site {mTOR} inhibitors ({asTORi}) are more potent inhibitors of {mTOR}, show superior anti-neoplastic effects in preclinical models, and are under investigation in clinical trials.Direct inhibition of {eIF}4F is being investigated in preclinical and clinical settings (for example, {eIF}4E antisense oligonucleotides, inhibitors of {eIF}4E–5′-{mRNA}-cap and {eIF}4E–{eIF}4G interaction, and inhibitors of {eIF}4A). In particular, {eIF}4A inhibitors display impressive anti-neoplastic effects, with efforts underway to improve their pharmacodynamics for use in the clinic.},

	abstract = {Abstract Estrogen receptor alpha ({ERα}) activity is associated with increased cancer cell proliferation. Studies aiming to understand the impact of {ERα} on cancer-associated phenotypes have largely been limited to its transcriptional activity. Herein, we demonstrate that {ERα} coordinates its transcriptional output with selective modulation of {mRNA} translation. Importantly, translational perturbations caused by depletion of {ERα} largely manifest as ?translational offsetting? of the transcriptome, whereby amounts of translated {mRNAs} and corresponding protein levels are maintained constant despite changes in {mRNA} abundance. Transcripts whose levels, but not polysome association, are reduced following {ERα} depletion lack features which limit translation efficiency including structured 5?{UTRs} and {miRNA} target sites. In contrast, {mRNAs} induced upon {ERα} depletion whose polysome association remains unaltered are enriched in codons requiring U34-modified {tRNAs} for efficient decoding. Consistently, {ERα} regulates levels of U34-modifying enzymes and thereby controls levels of U34-modified {tRNAs}. These findings unravel a hitherto unprecedented mechanism of {ERα}-dependent orchestration of transcriptional and translational programs that may be a pervasive mechanism of proteome maintenance in hormone-dependent cancers.},

The spatial and temporal variations of {mRNAs}, as well as the local availability of resources for protein biosynthesis, strongly influence the relationship between protein levels and their coding transcripts. We further discuss the buffering of {mRNA} fluctuations at the level of protein concentrations. We conclude that transcript levels by themselves are not sufficient to predict protein levels in many scenarios and to thus explain genotype-phenotype relationships and that high-quality data quantifying different levels of gene expression are indispensable for the complete understanding of biological processes.},

The target genes were highly enriched for insulin-related functions including lipid metabolism and protein synthesis and diseases including diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cancer. {IR} chromatin binding was increased by insulin and impaired in an insulin-resistant disease model. Promoter binding by {IR} was mediated by coregulator host cell factor-1 ({HCF}-1) and transcription factors, revealing an {HCF}-1-dependent pathway for gene regulation by insulin.

We report that in breast cancer cells {NANOG}, {SNAIL} and {NODAL} transcripts manifest multiple isoforms characterized by different 5’ Untranslated Regions (5’{UTRs}), whereby translation of a subset of these isoforms is stimulated under hypoxia. The accumulation of the corresponding proteins induces plasticity and “fate-switching” toward stem cell-like phenotypes. Mechanistically, we observe that {mTOR} inhibitors and chemotherapeutics induce translational activation of a subset of {NANOG}, {SNAIL} and {NODAL} {mRNA} isoforms akin to hypoxia, engendering stem-cell-like phenotypes. These effects are overcome with drugs that antagonize translational reprogramming caused by {eIF}2α phosphorylation (e.g. {ISRIB}), suggesting that the Integrated Stress Response drives breast cancer plasticity.

	abstract = {A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read counts from {RNA}-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between {RNA} samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the {edgeR} package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods ({GLMs}) to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of {GLMs} to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from {DNA}-Seq applications, including {ChIP}-Seq for epigenetic marks and {DNA} methylation analyses.},

	abstract = {Regulation of gene expression through translational control is a fundamental mechanism implicated in many biological processes ranging from memory formation to innate immunity and whose dysregulation contributes to human diseases. Genome wide analyses of translational control strive to identify differential translation independent of cytosolic {mRNA} levels. For this reason, most studies measure genes’ translation levels as log ratios (translation levels divided by corresponding cytosolic {mRNA} levels obtained in parallel). Counterintuitively, arising from a mathematical necessity, these log ratios tend to be highly correlated with the cytosolic {mRNA} levels. Accordingly, they do not effectively correct for cytosolic {mRNA} level and generate substantial numbers of biological false positives and false negatives. We show that analysis of partial variance, which produces estimates of translational activity that are independent of cytosolic {mRNA} levels, is a superior alternative. When combined with a variance shrinkage method for estimating error variance, analysis of partial variance has the additional benefit of having greater statistical power and identifying fewer genes as translationally regulated resulting merely from unrealistically low variance estimates rather than from large changes in translational activity. In contrast to log ratios, this formal analytical approach estimates translation effects in a statistically rigorous manner, eliminates the need for inefficient and error-prone heuristics, and produces results that agree with biological function. The method is applicable to datasets obtained from both the commonly used polysome microarray method and the sequencing-based ribosome profiling method.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Global analysis of translation regulation has recently been enabled by the development of Ribosome Profiling, or Ribo-seq, technology. This approach provides maps of ribosome activity for each expressed gene in a given biological sample. Measurements of translation efficiency are generated when Ribo-seq data is analyzed in combination with matched {RNA}-seq gene expression profiles. Existing computational methods for identifying genes with differential translation across samples are based on sound principles, but require users to choose between accuracy and speed.
Results: We present Riborex, a computational tool for mapping genome-wide differences in translation efficiency. Riborex shares a similar mathematical structure with existing methods, but has a simplified implementation. Riborex directly leverages established {RNA}-seq analysis frameworks for all parameter estimation, providing users with a choice among robust engines for these computations. The result is a method that is dramatically faster than available methods without sacrificing accuracy.

Using a microarray-based strategy, we find that, within minutes after the induction of amino acid starvation, the splicing of the majority of {RPGs} is specifically inhibited. In response to an unrelated stress, exposure to toxic levels of ethanol, splicing of a different group of transcripts is inhibited, while the splicing of a third set is actually improved.

Biochemical and genetic studies have instead revealed high levels of coupling between the different stages. In recent years, genome-wide and systems-level analyses have greatly extended our understanding of coupling in gene expression, by both revealing the effect that certain forms of coupling have on a more global scale, and unveiling novel forms of coupling that had not been identified using more traditional techniques.Genomic analyses of the binding of transcription factors and chromatin remodellers with {DNA} have revealed extensive coordination and coupling between these factors, forming regulatory networks that control how many genes are expressed.Genome-wide analysis of associations between the nuclear pore and nuclear lamina revealed extensive coupling between the transcription level of a given gene and its nuclear localization. In particular, different subcomplexes within the nuclear pore associate with specific types of genetic loci.Genomic analyses of {mRNA} processing have shown that splicing commitment occurs co-transcriptionally, but that in yeast the splicing completes post-transcriptionally, and that the spliceosome can regulate expression of specific types of {mRNAs} by increasing or decreasing their splicing efficiencies.Microarray analyses have also shown that the co-transcriptional recruitment of {mRNA} export factors results in functional specificities, in which different factors transport specific types of {mRNAs}; the combination of whole-genome screens and array analyses also demonstrated an important role for the exosome in {mRNA} export.Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray ({ChIP}–chip) analyses in higher eukaryotes provide support for a dynamic messenger ribonucleoprotein ({mRNP}) model, in which the composition of the {mRNP} associated with the nascent transcript changes along the length of the transcript.Whole-genome analysis of the associations between proteasomal components and chromatin revealed a widespread role for the proteasome in transcriptional activation and enrichment of binding of the proteasome at ribosomal protein genes. This coupling between the protein synthesis and degradation machineries could allow feedback that globally reduces expression levels when the proteasome is compromised.Network analysis of the genomic associations of many factors involved in gene expression revealed novel connections between the different levels of gene expression. In particular, factors involved in nuclear transport, general transcription factors, {RNA}-processing factors and nucleosome remodellers were found to exhibit highly similar binding profiles and to have a large number of neighbours, allowing them to exert global influences on many genes at once.},

Understanding how human genetic variation affects phenotype requires tissue- or even cell type–specific measurements. Kim-Hellmuth et al. used computational methods to identify cell-type proportions within bulk tissues in the Genotype-Tissue Expression ({GTEx}) project dataset to identify cell-type interaction quantitative trait loci and map these to genetic variants correlated with expression or splicing differences between individuals. By characterizing the cellular context, this study illustrates how genetic variants that operate in a cell type–specific manner affect gene regulation and can be linked to complex traits. This deconvolution and analysis of cell types from bulk tissues allows greater precision in understanding how phenotypes are linked to genetic variation.

Structured Abstract
{INTRODUCTIONEfforts} to map quantitative trait loci ({QTLs}) across human tissues by the {GTEx} Consortium and others have identified expression and splicing {QTLs} ({eQTLs} and {sQTLs}, respectively) for a majority of genes. However, these studies were largely performed with gene expression measurements from bulk tissue samples, thus obscuring the cellular specificity of genetic regulatory effects and in turn limiting their functional interpretation. Identifying the cell type (or types) in which a {QTL} is active will be key to uncovering the molecular mechanisms that underlie complex trait variation. Recent studies demonstrated the feasibility of identifying cell type–specific {QTLs} from bulk tissue {RNA}-sequencing data by using computational estimates of cell type proportions. To date, such approaches have only been applied to a limited number of cell types and tissues. By applying this methodology to {GTEx} tissues for a diverse set of cell types, we aim to characterize the cellular specificity of genetic effects across human tissues and to describe the contribution of these effects to complex traits.
{RATIONALEA} growing number of in silico cell type deconvolution methods and associated reference panels with cell type–specific marker genes enable the robust estimation of the enrichment of specific cell types from bulk tissue gene expression data. We benchmarked and used enrichment estimates for seven cell types (adipocytes, epithelial cells, hepatocytes, keratinocytes, myocytes, neurons, and neutrophils) across 35 tissues from the {GTEx} project to map {QTLs} that are specific to at least one cell type. We mapped such cell type–interaction {QTLs} for expression and splicing ({ieQTLs} and {isQTLs}, respectively) by testing for interactions between genotype and cell type enrichment.
{RESULTSUsing} 43 pairs of tissues and cell types, we found 3347 protein-coding and long intergenic noncoding {RNA} ({lincRNA}) genes with an {ieQTL} and 987 genes with an {isQTL} (at 5\% false discovery rate in each pair). To validate these findings, we tested the {QTLs} for replication in available external datasets and applied an independent validation using allele-specific expression from {eQTL} heterozygotes. We analyzed the cell type–interaction {QTLs} for patterns of tissue sharing and found that {ieQTLs} are enriched for genes with tissue-specific {eQTLs} and are generally not shared across unrelated tissues, suggesting that tissue-specific {eQTLs} originate in tissue-specific cell types. Last, we tested the {ieQTLs} and {isQTLs} for colocalization with genetic associations for 87 complex traits. We show that cell type–interaction {QTLs} are enriched for complex trait associations and identify colocalizations for hundreds of loci that were undetected in bulk tissue, corresponding to an increase of {\textgreater}50\% over colocalizations with standard {QTLs}. Our results also reveal the cellular specificity and potential origin for a similar number of colocalized standard {QTLs}.
{CONCLUSIONThe} {ieQTLs} and {isQTLs} identified for seven cell types across {GTEx} tissues suggest that the large majority of cell type–specific {QTLs} remains to be discovered. Our colocalization results indicate that comprehensive mapping of cell type–specific {QTLs} will be highly valuable for gaining a mechanistic understanding of complex trait associations. We anticipate that the approaches presented here will complement studies mapping {QTLs} in single cells. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/369/6509/eaaz8528/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Detection of cell type–specific effects on gene expression.The enrichment of seven cell types is calculated across {GTEx} tissues, enabling mapping of cell type–interaction {QTLs} for expression and splicing by testing for significant interactions between genotypes and cell type enrichments. Linking these {QTLs} to complex trait associations enables discovery of {\textgreater}50\% more colocalizations compared with standard {QTLs} and reveals the cellular specificity of traits.
The Genotype-Tissue Expression ({GTEx}) project has identified expression and splicing quantitative trait loci in cis ({QTLs}) for the majority of genes across a wide range of human tissues. However, the functional characterization of these {QTLs} has been limited by the heterogeneous cellular composition of {GTEx} tissue samples. We mapped interactions between computational estimates of cell type abundance and genotype to identify cell type–interaction {QTLs} for seven cell types and show that cell type–interaction expression {QTLs} ({eQTLs}) provide finer resolution to tissue specificity than bulk tissue cis-{eQTLs}. Analyses of genetic associations with 87 complex traits show a contribution from cell type–interaction {QTLs} and enables the discovery of hundreds of previously unidentified colocalized loci that are masked in bulk tissue.
Cell type composition, estimated from bulk tissue, maps the cellular specificity of genetic variants.

	abstract = {{mRNA} translation is the most energy-consuming process in the cell and strongly correlates with cellular metabolic activity. Translation and energy metabolism play important roles in homeostatic cell growth and proliferation, and when dysregulated lead to cancer. {eIF}4E is a key regulator of translation, which promotes oncogenesis by selectively enhancing translation of a subset of tumor-promoting {mRNAs} (e.g., cyclins and c-myc). {PI}3K/{AKT} and mitogen-activated protein kinase ({MAPK}) pathways, which are strongly implicated in cancer etiology, exert a number of their biological effects by modulating translation. The {PI}3K/{AKT} pathway regulates {eIF}4E function by inactivating the inhibitory 4E-{BPs} via {mTORC}1, whereas {MAPKs} activate {MAP} kinase signal-integrating kinases 1 and 2, which phosphorylate {eIF}4E. In addition, {AMP}-activated protein kinase, which is a central sensor of the cellular energy balance, impairs translation by inhibiting {mTORC}1. Thus, {eIF}4E plays a major role in mediating the effects of {PI}3K/{AKT}, {MAPK}, and cellular energetics on {mRNA} translation.},

The {eIF}5 stimulates {GTP} hydrolysis by the {eIF}2/{GTP}/Met-{tRNAi} Met ternary complex on base-pairing between Met-{tRNAi} Met and the start codon. The {eIF}2, {eIF}5, and {eIF}1 all have been implicated in stringent selection of {AUG} as the start codon. The {eIF}3 binds to the 40S ribosome and promotes recruitment of the ternary complex; however, physical contact between {eIF}3 and {eIF}2 has not been observed. We show that yeast {eIF}5 can bridge interaction in vitro between {eIF}3 and {eIF}2 by binding simultaneously to the amino terminus of {eIF}3 subunit {NIP}1 and the amino-terminal half of {eIF}2β, dependent on a conserved bipartite motif in the carboxyl terminus of {eIF}5. Additionally, the amino terminus of {NIP}1 can bind concurrently to {eIF}5 and {eIF}1. These findings suggest the occurrence of an {eIF}3/{eIF}1/{eIF}5/{eIF}2 multifactor complex, which was observed in cell extracts free of 40S ribosomes and found to contain stoichiometric amounts of {tRNAi} Met. The multifactor complex was disrupted by the tif5-7A mutation in the bipartite motif of {eIF}5. Importantly, the tif5-7A mutant is temperature sensitive and displayed a substantial reduction in translation initiation at the restrictive temperature. We propose that the multifactor complex is an important intermediate in translation initiation in vivo.},

We report the cloning and characterization of human {cDNAs} encoding two of its subunits, p110 and p36. It was found that the second slowest band during polyacrylamide gel electrophresis of {eIF}3 subunits in sodium dodecyl sulfate contains two proteins: p110 and p116. Analysis of the cloned {cDNA} encoding p110 indicates that its amino acid sequence is 31\% identical to that of the yeast protein, Nip1. The p116 {cDNA} was cloned and characterized as a human homolog of yeast Prt1, as described elsewhere (Méthot, N., Rom, E., Olsen, H., and Sonenberg, N. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 1110-1116). p36 is a {WD}40 repeat protein, which is 46\% identical to the p39 subunit of yeast {eIF}3 and is identical to {TRIP}-1, a phosphorylation substrate of the {TGF}-β type {II} receptor. The p116, p110, and p36 subunits localize on 40 S ribosomes in cells active in translation and co-immunoprecipitate with affinity-purified antibodies against the p170 subunit, showing that these proteins are integral components of {eIF}3. Although p36 and p116 have homologous protein subunits in yeast {eIF}3, the p110 homolog, Nip1, is not detected in yeast {eIF}3 preparations. The results indicate both conservation and diversity in {eIF}3 between yeast and humans.},

	abstract = {During translation elongation, the ribosome ratchets along its {mRNA} template, incorporating each new amino acid and translocating from one codon to the next. The elongation cycle requires dramatic structural rearrangements of the ribosome. We show here that deep sequencing of ribosome-protected {mRNA} fragments reveals not only the position of each ribosome but also, unexpectedly, its particular stage of the elongation cycle. Sequencing reveals two distinct populations of ribosome footprints, 28–30 nucleotides and 20–22 nucleotides long, representing translating ribosomes in distinct states, differentially stabilized by specific elongation inhibitors. We find that the balance of small and large footprints varies by codon and is correlated with translation speed. The ability to visualize conformational changes in the ribosome during elongation, at single-codon resolution, provides a new way to study the detailed kinetics of translation and a new probe with which to identify the factors that affect each step in the elongation cycle.},

	abstract = {Messenger {RNA} abundance is determined by balancing transcription and {RNA} decay. {mRNA} stability can be rapidly modulated to alter the expression of specific genes thereby providing flexibility in effecting changes in patterns of protein synthesis. An evolutionarily conserved {mRNA}-degradation pathway is initiated by the removal of the 3′ poly(A) tail. This disrupts the translation initiation complex and provides degradative enzymes with access to the 5′ cap and remaining {RNA} body. The intimate relationship between {mRNA} decay and translation is further indicated by the ability of translation-initiation factors and proteins that bind the poly(A) tail to protect the {mRNA} from degradation. Moreover, evidence shows that inhibiting translation elongation promotes {mRNA} stabilization The turnover of {mRNAs} is also regulated by cis-acting elements that either promote or inhibit their decay. The most prevalent is the A+U-rich element ({ARE}), found in the 3′untranslated region (3′ {UTR}) of {mRNAs} encoding many important growth control proteins. {ARE}-binding proteins affect {mRNA} stability, translation and subcellular localization. Other elements found in the 5′ {UTR} and coding regions also modulate transcript stability. Several signalling pathways are implicated in triggering changes in stability of specific {mRNAs}. One example is the interleukin-2 {mRNA}, which is stabilized by the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase ({JNK}) signalling pathway through {JNK}-responsive elements in its 5′{UTR}. A strong link between translation and {RNA} turnover is also shown by nonsense-mediated decay, which ensures that {mRNAs} containing premature stop codons are degraded.},

	abstract = {Rationale:Regulatory T (Treg) cells suppress immune responses and have been shown to attenuate atherosclerosis. The Treg cell lineage-specification factor {FOXP}3 (forkhead box P3) is essential for Treg cells’ ability to uphold immunologic tolerance. In humans, {FOXP}3 exists in several different isoforms, however, their specific role is poorly understood.Objective:To define the regulation and functions of the 2 major {FOXP}3 isoforms, {FOXP}3fl and {FOXP}3Δ2, as well as to establish whether their expression is associated with the ischemic atherosclerotic disease.Methods and Results:Human primary T cells were transduced with lentiviruses encoding distinct {FOXP}3 isoforms. The phenotype and function of these cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, in vitro suppression assays and {RNA}-sequencing. We also assessed the effect of activation on Treg cells isolated from healthy volunteers. Treg cell activation resulted in increased {FOXP}3 expression that predominantly was made up of {FOXP}3Δ2. {FOXP}3Δ2 induced specific transcription of {GARP} (glycoprotein A repetitions predominant), which functions by tethering the immunosuppressive cytokine {TGF} (transforming growth factor)-β to the cell membrane of activated Treg cells. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the impact of alternative splicing of {FOXP}3 in relation with atherosclerotic plaque stability in a cohort of {\textgreater}150 patients that underwent carotid endarterectomy. Plaque instability was associated with a lower {FOXP}3Δ2 transcript usage, when comparing plaques from patients without symptoms and patients with the occurrence of recent ({\textless}1 month) vascular symptoms including minor stroke, transient ischemic attack, or amaurosis fugax. No difference was detected in total levels of {FOXP}3 {mRNA} between these 2 groups.Conclusions:These results suggest that activated Treg cells suppress the atherosclerotic disease process and that {FOXP}3Δ2 controls a transcriptional program that acts protectively in human atherosclerotic plaques.},

Single base substitutions around an upstream, out-of-frame {ATG} codon affect the efficiency with which it acts as a barrier to initiating at the downstream start site for preproinsulin.

We exploit the propensity of harringtonine to cause ribosomes to accumulate at sites of translation initiation together with a machine learning algorithm to define protein products systematically. Analysis of translation in mouse embryonic stem cells reveals thousands of strong pause sites and unannotated translation products. These include amino-terminal extensions and truncations and upstream open reading frames with regulatory potential, initiated at both {AUG} and non-{AUG} codons, whose translation changes after differentiation.

Insertion of an upstream {AUG} triplet that was out-of-frame with respect to the coding sequence for preproinsulin red iced the yield of proinsulin, in keeping with the predictions of the scanning model. The extent to which an upstream {AUG} codon interfered depended on sequences surrounding the {AUG} triplet; with two constructs (p255/20 and C2) the 5′-proximal {AUG} codon constituted an absolute barrier: there was no initiation at the downstream start site for preproinsulin. With two other constructs (p255/9, p255/21), however, proinsulin was made despite the presence of an upstream, out-of-frame {AUG} codon in a favorable context for initiation. In those cases the reading frame set by the first {AUG} triplet was short, terminating before the start of the preproinsulin coding sequence. The interpretation that ribosomes initiate at the first {AUG}, terminate, and then reinitiate at the {AUG} that directly precedes the preproinsulin coding sequence was tested by introducing a point mutation that eliminated the terminator codon: the resulting mutant made no proinsulin.},

	abstract = {Termination of {mRNA} translation occurs when a stop codon enters the A site of the ribosome, and in eukaryotes is mediated by release factors {eRF}1 and {eRF}3, which form a ternary {eRF}1/{eRF}3–guanosine triphosphate ({GTP}) complex. {eRF}1 recognizes the stop codon, and after hydrolysis of {GTP} by {eRF}3, mediates release of the nascent peptide. The post-termination complex is then disassembled, enabling its constituents to participate in further rounds of translation. Ribosome recycling involves splitting of the 80S ribosome by the {ATP}-binding cassette protein {ABCE}1 to release the 60S subunit. Subsequent dissociation of deacylated transfer {RNA} ({tRNA}) and messenger {RNA} ({mRNA}) from the 40S subunit may be mediated by initiation factors (priming the 40S subunit for initiation), by ligatin ({eIF}2D) or by density-regulated protein ({DENR}) and multiple copies in T-cell lymphoma-1 ({MCT}1). These events may be subverted by suppression of termination (yielding carboxy-terminally extended read-through polypeptides) or by interruption of recycling, leading to reinitiation of translation near the stop codon.},

	abstract = {The product of the yeast {SUP}45 gene (Sup45p) is highly homologous to the Xenopus eukaryote release factor 1 ({eRF}1), which has release factor activity in vitro. We show, using the two-hybrid system, that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sup45p and the product of the {SUP}35 gene (Sup35p) interact in vivo. The ability of Sup45p C-terminally tagged with (His)6 to specifically precipitate Sup35p from a cell lysate was used to confirm this interaction in vitro. Although overexpression of either the {SUP}45 or {SUP}35 genes alone did not reduce the efficiency of codon-specific {tRNA} nonsense suppression, the simultaneous overexpression of both the {SUP}35 and {SUP}45 genes in nonsense suppressor {tRNA}-containing strains produced an antisuppressor phenotype. These data are consistent with Sup35p and Sup45p forming a complex with release factor properties. Furthermore, overexpression of either Xenopus or human {eRF}1 ({SUP}45) genes also resulted in anti-suppression only if that strain was also overexpressing the yeast {SUP}35 gene. Antisuppression is a characteristic phenotype associated with overexpression of both prokaryote and mitochondrial release factors. We propose that Sup45p and Sup35p interact to form a release factor complex in yeast and that Sup35p, which has {GTP} binding sequence motifs in its C-terminal domain, provides the {GTP} hydrolytic activity which is a demonstrated requirement of the eukaryote translation termination reaction.},

Here, we reconstituted all steps of eukaryotic translation in vitro using purified ribosomal subunits; initiation, elongation, and termination factors; and aminoacyl {tRNAs}. This allowed us to investigate termination using pretermination complexes assembled on {mRNA} encoding a tetrapeptide and to propose a model for translation termination that accounts for the cooperative action of {eRF}1 and {eRF}3 in ensuring fast release of nascent polypeptide. In this model, binding of {eRF}1, {eRF}3, and {GTP} to pretermination complexes first induces a structural rearrangement that is manifested as a 2 nucleotide forward shift of the toeprint attributed to pretermination complexes that leads to {GTP} hydrolysis followed by rapid hydrolysis of peptidyl {tRNA}.

Here, we report that {ABCE}1, a conserved and essential member of the {ATP}-binding cassette ({ABC}) family of proteins, promotes eukaryotic ribosomal recycling over a wide range of Mg2+ concentrations. {ABCE}1 dissociates post-{TCs} into free 60S subunits and {mRNA}- and {tRNA}-bound 40S subunits. It can hydrolyze {ATP}, {GTP}, {UTP}, and {CTP}. {NTP} hydrolysis by {ABCE}1 is stimulated by post-{TCs} and is required for its recycling activity.

In contrast, the binding of {ATP} prevents its activation. {AMPK} regulates a multitude of metabolic processes that cumulatively function to maintain cellular energy homeostasis through repression of a number of energy-consuming processes with simultaneous enhancement of energy-producing processes. One downstream {AMPK} target that has been recently identified is the mammalian target of rapamycin ({mTOR}), a positive effector of cell growth and division.

	abstract = {{AMPK} ({AMP}-activated protein kinase) is activated allosterically by {AMP} and by phosphorylation of Thr172 within the catalytic alpha subunit. Here we show that mutations in the regulatory gamma subunit reduce allosteric activation of the kinase by {AMP}. In addition to its allosteric effect, {AMP} significantly reduces the dephosphorylation of Thr172 by {PP} (protein phosphatase)2Calpha. Moreover, a mutation in the gamma subunit almost completely abolishes the inhibitory effect of {AMP} on dephosphorylation. We were unable to detect any effect of {AMP} on Thr172 phosphorylation by either {LKB}1 or {CaMKKbeta} (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta) using recombinant preparations of the proteins. However, using partially purified {AMPK} from rat liver, there was an apparent {AMP}-stimulation of Thr172 phosphorylation by {LKB}1, but this was blocked by the addition of {NaF}, a {PP} inhibitor. Western blotting of partially purified rat liver {AMPK} and {LKB}1 revealed the presence of {PP}2Calpha in the preparations. We suggest that previous studies reporting that {AMP} promotes phosphorylation of Thr172 were misinterpreted. A plausible explanation for this effect of {AMP} is inhibition of dephosphorylation by {PP}2Calpha, present in the preparations of the kinases used in the earlier studies. Taken together, our results demonstrate that {AMP} activates {AMPK} via two mechanisms: by direct allosteric activation and by protecting Thr172 from dephosphorylation. On the basis of our new findings, we propose a simple model for the regulation of {AMPK} in mammalian cells by {LKB}1 and {CaMKKbeta}. This model accounts for activation of {AMPK} by two distinct signals: a Ca2+-dependent pathway, mediated by {CaMKKbeta} and an {AMP}-dependent pathway, mediated by {LKB}1.},

Phosphorylation of {TSC}2 by {AMPK} is required for translation regulation and cell size control in response to energy deprivation. Furthermore, {TSC}2 and its phosphorylation by {AMPK} protect cells from energy deprivation-induced apoptosis.

In both cell types, acute and 24-h hypoxia decreased total {JO}2 significantly and reoxygenation restored {JO}2 after 5 min but not after 24 h of hypoxia in A549 cells, whereas recovery was complete in type {II} cells. In A549 cells under normoxia Na/K-{ATPase} accounted for approximately 15\% of {JO}2, whereas Na/K-{ATPase}-related {JO}2 was decreased by approximately 25\% in hypoxia. Inhibition of other ion transporters did not affect {JO}2. Protein synthesis-related {JO}2 was not affected by acute hypoxia, but decreased by 30\% after 24-h hypoxia.

Importantly, metformin's antiproliferative activity can be explained by selective translational suppression of {mRNAs} encoding cell-cycle regulators via the {mTORC}1/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein pathway. Thus, metformin selectively inhibits translation of {mRNAs} encoding proteins that promote neoplastic proliferation, which should facilitate studies on metformin and related biguanides in cancer prevention and treatment.},

Comparisons of gene expression patterns identified correspondences of developmental stages across species, and differences in the timing of key events during the development of the gonads. We found that the breadth of gene expression and the extent of purifying selection gradually decrease during development, whereas the amount of positive selection and expression of new genes increase. We identified differences in the temporal trajectories of expression of individual genes across species, with brain tissues showing the smallest percentage of trajectory changes, and the liver and testis showing the largest.

Although gene expression is tightly controlled at both the {RNA} and protein levels, the quantitative contribution of each step, especially during dynamic responses, remains largely unknown. Indeed, there has been much debate whether changes in {RNA} level contribute substantially to protein-level regulation. Jovanovic et al. built a genome-scale model of the temporal dynamics of differential protein expression during the stimulation of immunological dendritic cells (see the Perspective by Li and Biggin). Newly stimulated functions involved the up-regulation of specific {RNAs} and concomitant increases in the levels of the proteins they encode, whereas housekeeping functions were regulated posttranscriptionally at the protein level.

Structured Abstract
{INTRODUCTIONMammalian} gene expression is tightly controlled through the interplay between the {RNA} and protein life cycles. Although studies of individual genes have shown that regulation of each of these processes is important for correct protein expression, the quantitative contribution of each step to changes in protein expression levels remains largely unknown and much debated. Many studies have attempted to address this question in the context of steady-state protein levels, and comparing steady-state {RNA} and protein abundances has indicated a considerable discrepancy between {RNA} and protein levels. In contrast, only a few studies have attempted to shed light on how changes in each of these processes determine differential protein expression—either relative (ratios) or absolute (differences)—during dynamic responses, and only one recent report has attempted to quantitate each process. Understanding these contributions to a dynamic response on a systems scale is essential both for deciphering how cells deploy regulatory processes to accomplish physiological changes and for discovering key molecular regulators controlling each process.
{RATIONALEWe} developed an integrated experimental and computational strategy to quantitatively assess how protein levels are maintained in the context of a dynamic response and applied it to the model response of mouse immune bone marrow–derived dendritic cells ({DCs}) to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide ({LPS}). We used a modified pulsed-{SILAC} (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) approach to track newly synthesized and previously labeled proteins over the first 12 hours of the response. In addition, we independently measured replicate {RNA}-sequencing profiles under the same conditions. We devised a computational strategy to infer per-{mRNA} translation rates and protein degradation rates at each time point from the temporal transcriptional profiles and pulsed-{SILAC} proteomics data. This allowed us to build a genome-scale quantitative model of the temporal dynamics of differential protein expression in {DCs} responding to {LPS}.
{RESULTSWe} found that before stimulation, {mRNA} levels contribute to overall protein expression levels more than double the combined contribution of protein translation and degradation rates. Upon {LPS} stimulation, changes in {mRNA} abundance play an even more dominant role in dynamic changes in protein levels, especially in immune response genes. Nevertheless, several protein modules—especially the preexisting proteome of proteins performing basic cellular functions—are predominantly regulated in stimulated cells at the level of protein translation or degradation, accounting for over half of the absolute change in protein molecules in the cell. In particular, despite the repression of their transcripts, the level of many proteins in the translational machinery is up-regulated upon {LPS} stimulation because of significantly increased translation rates, and elevated protein degradation of mitochondrial proteins plays a central role in remodeling cellular energy metabolism.
{CONCLUSIONSOur} results support a model in which the induction of novel cellular functions is primarily driven through transcriptional changes, whereas regulation of protein production or degradation updates the levels of preexisting functions as required for an activated state. Our approach for building quantitative genome-scale models of the temporal dynamics of protein expression is broadly applicable to other dynamic systems. {\textless}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/347/6226/1259038/F1.medium.gif"/{\textgreater} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Dynamic protein expression regulation in dendritic cells upon stimulation with {LPS}.We developed an integrated experimental and computational strategy to quantitatively assess how protein levels are maintained in the context of a dynamic response. Our results support a model in which the induction of novel cellular functions is primarily driven through transcriptional changes, whereas regulation of protein production or degradation updates the levels of preexisting functions.
Protein expression is regulated by the production and degradation of messenger {RNAs} ({mRNAs}) and proteins, but their specific relationships remain unknown. We combine measurements of protein production and degradation and {mRNA} dynamics so as to build a quantitative genomic model of the differential regulation of gene expression in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse dendritic cells. Changes in {mRNA} abundance play a dominant role in determining most dynamic fold changes in protein levels. Conversely, the preexisting proteome of proteins performing basic cellular functions is remodeled primarily through changes in protein production or degradation, accounting for more than half of the absolute change in protein molecules in the cell. Thus, the proteome is regulated by transcriptional induction for newly activated cellular functions and by protein life-cycle changes for remodeling of preexisting functions.
Levels of “housekeeping” proteins are maintained directly, but those of immune response proteins depend on more transcription. [Also see Perspective by Li and Biggin]

Overall, the two regulatory levels were equally important, but differed in their impact on molecule concentrations. Both {mRNA} and protein changes peaked between two and eight hours, but {mRNA} expression fold changes were much smaller than those of the proteins. {mRNA} concentrations shifted in a transient, pulse-like pattern and returned to values close to pre-treatment levels by the end of the experiment. In contrast, protein concentrations switched only once and established a new steady state, consistent with the dominant role of protein regulation during misfolding stress.

	abstract = {Translation is a cyclical process in which ribosomal subunits that participate in initiation are derived by recycling of post-termination ribosomal complexes (post-{TCs}) that have completed the previous round of translation. Post-{TCs} first dissociate into free 60S subunits and 40S subunits bound to {mRNA} and with a P-site deacylated {tRNA}. Release of {tRNA} and {mRNA} from recycled 40S subunits requires eukaryotic initiation factor 3 ({eIF}3), {eIF}1 and {eIF}1A. Deacylated {tRNA}, which is removed from the P-site of the ribosomal 40S subunit, is replaced by Met-{tRNAMeti}, which binds as a ternary complex with {eIF}2-{GTP}.Initiation on most eukaryotic {mRNAs} involves scanning by ribosomal 43S preinitiation complexes on the 5′ untranslated region ({UTR}) from the 5′ cap-proximal point of initial attachment to the initiation codon. The mechanism of scanning is incompletely understood, but requires an 'open' conformation of the 40S subunit, which is induced by {eIF}1 and {eIF}1A, is coupled to the activities of the {DEAD}-box {RNA} helicase {eIF}4A, its cofactor {eIF}4B and {eIF}4G, and may involve additional {DEAD} box- or {DExH} box-containing proteins such as {DExH} box protein 29 ({DHX}29; higher eukaryotes) and {DEAD} box helicase 1 (Ded1; yeast).In a current model for initiation codon recognition, establishment of codon–anticodon base pairing is accompanied by displacement of {eIF}1 from the P-site, which switches the 40S subunit to a closed conformation that is locked onto {mRNA} and relieves repression of {eIF}5-induced hydrolysis of {eIF}2-bound {GTP} and Pi release. {eIF}5B then mediates the dissociation of {eIF}2–{GDP}, {eIF}1 and {eIF}1A from the interface surface of the 40S subunit and the joining to it of a 60S ribosomal subunit, to form an 80S ribosome with initiator {tRNA} in the P-site.Regulation of {eIF} activity by reversible phosphorylation affects most {mRNAs} that are translated by the canonical scanning-dependent mode of initiation. The best-characterized examples are phosphorylation of mammalian {eIF}2 by any of four stress-activated kinases (which leads to a reduction in the level of {eIF}2–{GTP}–Met-{tRNAMeti} ternary complexes) and of mammalian 4E-binding proteins, mainly by {mTOR} (in response to mitogens and growth factors), which releases {eIF}4E for assimilation into {eIF}4F and promotes translation.Sequence-specific {RNA}-binding proteins have the potential to selectively regulate specific {mRNAs} or classes of {mRNA}. 3′ {UTR}-binding proteins commonly repress translation by forming an inhibitory closed loop with a 5′ cap-binding protein (which may be {eIF}4E) and an intermediate bridging protein, whereas poly(A)-binding protein ({PABP}) bound to the 3′ poly(A) tail enhances initiation, possibly by tethering {eIF}4F so that it is available, despite dissociation from the 5′ cap, to promote further rounds of initiation on the same {mRNA} without having to be recruited de novo from solution.{MicroRNAs} have recently emerged as important regulators of translation that also act by binding to the 3′ {UTR}. The mechanism of repression has not yet been fully elucidated, but appears to have two components, both mediated by the carboxy-terminal domain of the protein {GW}182: true repression of translation and an accelerated rate of deadenylation-dependent {mRNA} degradation.},

The {eIF}4F subunit {eIF}4E interacts directly with the {mRNA} 5′ cap structure. Assembly of the {eIF}4F complex is inhibited by a family of repressor polypeptides, the {eIF}4E-binding proteins (4E-{BPs}). Binding of the 4E-{BPs} to {eIF}4E is regulated by phosphorylation: Hypophosphorylated 4E-{BP} isoforms interact strongly with {eIF}4E, whereas hyperphosphorylated isoforms do not. 4E-{BP}1 is hypophosphorylated in quiescent cells, but is hyperphosphorylated on multiple sites following exposure to a variety of extracellular stimuli. The {PI}3-kinase/Akt pathway and the kinase {FRAP}/{mTOR} signal to 4E-{BP}1. {FRAP}/{mTOR} has been reported to phosphorylate 4E-{BP}1 directly in vitro. However, it is not known if {FRAP}/{mTOR} is responsible for the phosphorylation of all 4E-{BP}1 sites, nor which sites must be phosphorylated to release 4E-{BP}1 from {eIF}4E. To address these questions, a recombinant {FRAP}/{mTOR} protein and a {FRAP}/{mTOR} immunoprecipitate were utilized in in vitro kinase assays to phosphorylate 4E-{BP}1. Phosphopeptide mapping of the in vitro-labeled protein yielded two 4E-{BP}1 phosphopeptides that comigrated with phosphopeptides produced in vivo. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that these peptides contain phosphorylated Thr-37 and Thr-46. Thr-37 and Thr-46 are efficiently phosphorylated in vitro by {FRAP}/{mTOR} when 4E-{BP}1 is bound to {eIF}4E. However, phosphorylation at these sites was not associated with a loss of {eIF}4E binding. Phosphorylated Thr-37 and Thr-46 are detected in all phosphorylated in vivo 4E-{BP}1 isoforms, including those that interact with {eIF}4E. Finally, mutational analysis demonstrated that phosphorylation of Thr-37/Thr-46 is required for subsequent phosphorylation of several carboxy-terminal serum-sensitive sites. Taken together, our results suggest that 4E-{BP}1 phosphorylation by {FRAP}/{mTOR} on Thr-37 and Thr-46 is a priming event for subsequent phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal serum-sensitive sites.},

The aim of the project was to develop a method to identify hotspot mutations in the {PIK}3CA gene in circulating tumor cells ({CTCs}) of metastatic breast cancer ({metBC}) patients. From 44 enrolled {CTC}-positive {metBC} patients a total number of 57 peripheral blood samples were analysed by {CellSearch}®. Genomic {DNA} of enriched {CTCs} was isolated, amplified and analyzed for {PIK}3CA mutations in exons 9 and 20 which lead to E542K, E545K or H1047R amino acid changes and result in increased {PI}3K activity. The mutations were detected by using {SNaPshot}-methodology comprising {PCR} amplification and single nucleotide primer extension. {SNaPshot} analysis was established using genomic {DNA} from different breast cancer cell lines and then successfully transferred to investigate blood samples and single cells. Overall, twelve hotspot mutations in either exon 9/E545K (6/12, 50\%) or exon 20/H1047R (6/12, 50\%) could be determined within 9 out of 57 (15.8\%) blood samples from 7 out of 44 (15.9\%) patients; {CTC} counts ranged from 1 to 9748. {PIK}3CA variants E542K, E545G and E545A were not detected. Analysing the {PIK}3CA genotype of {CTCs} has clinical relevance with respect to drug resistance, e.g. against {HER}2-targeted therapy. The herein described approach including {SNaPshot} technology provides a simple method to characterize hotspot mutations within {CTCs} enriched from peripheral blood and can be easily adopted for analysing further therapeutically relevant {SNPs}.},

	abstract = {The insulin receptor ({IR}) and type 1 insulin-like growth factor ({IGF}-I) receptor ({IGFR}) are both widely expressed in mammalian tissues, and are known to be capable of heteromeric assembly as insulin/{IGF} hybrid receptors, in addition to the classically described receptors. By selective immunoadsorption of radioligand/receptor complexes and by immunoblotting we have determined the fraction of insulin receptors and {IGF} receptors occurring as hybrids in different tissues. Microsomal membranes were isolated from tissue homogenates and solubilized with Triton X-100. Solubilized receptors were incubated with 125I-{IGF}-I, and radioligand/receptor complexes bound by {IR}-specific and {IGFR}-specific monoclonal antibodies were quantified. The fraction of {IGF}-I binding sites behaving as hybrids (anti-{IR}-bound/anti-{IGFR}-bound) was approx. 40\% in liver and spleen, 70\% in placenta, and 85-90\% in skeletal muscle and heart, similar results being obtained in rabbit and human tissues. There was no correlation between the proportion of hybrids and the ratio of 125I-insulin/125I-{IGF}-I binding in different tissues. The fraction of 125I-insulin bound to hybrids was too low for accurate quantification, because of the relatively low affinity of hybrids for insulin. The fraction of insulin receptors present in hybrids was therefore determined by immunoblotting. Receptors in solubilized human placental microsomal membranes were precipitated with {IR}-specific or {IGFR}-specific monoclonal antibodies, and after {SDS}/{PAGE}, blots were prepared and probed with {IR}-specific and {IGFR}-specific antisera. It was found that 15\% of {IR} and 80\% of {IGFR} were present in hybrids. Consistent with these figures, the overall level of {IR} was estimated, by blotting with the respective antibodies at concentrations shown to give equal signals with equal amounts of receptor, to be 4-fold greater than {IGFR}. Overall it was concluded that a significant fraction of both {IR} and {IGFR} occurs as hybrids in most mammalian tissues, including those that are recognized targets of insulin and {IGF} action. The fraction of hybrids in different tissues was not a simple function of the relative levels of {IR} and {IGFR}, possibly because of heterogeneity of receptor expression in different cell types. However, in placenta the proportions of {IR}, {IGFR} and hybrids were consistent with a process of random assembly reflecting the molar ratio of {IR} and {IGFR} half-receptors.},

	abstract = {Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 ({IGF}-1) act on highly homologous receptors, yet in vivo elicit distinct effects on metabolism and growth. To investigate how the insulin and {IGF}-1 receptors exert specificity in their biological responses, we assessed their role in the regulation of gene expression using three experimental paradigms: 1) preadipocytes before and after differentiation into adipocytes that express both receptors, but at different ratios; 2) insulin receptor ({IR}) or {IGF}1R knock-out preadipocytes that only express the complimentary receptor; and 3) {IR}/{IGF}1R double knock-out ({DKO}) cells reconstituted with the {IR}, {IGF}1R, or both. In wild-type preadipocytes, which express predominantly {IGF}1R, microarray analysis revealed approximately 500 {IGF}-1 regulated genes (p {\textless} 0.05). The largest of these were confirmed by quantitative {PCR}, which also revealed that insulin produced a similar effect, but with a smaller magnitude of response. After differentiation, when {IR} levels increase and {IGF}1R decrease, insulin became the dominant regulator of each of these genes. Measurement of the 50 most highly regulated genes by quantitative {PCR} did not reveal a single gene regulated uniquely via the {IR} or {IGF}1R using cells expressing exclusively {IGF}-1 or insulin receptors. Insulin and {IGF}-1 dose responses from 1 to 100 nm in {WT}, {IRKO}, {IGFRKO}, and {DKO} cells re-expressing {IR}, {IGF}1R, or both showed that insulin and {IGF}-1 produced effects in proportion to the concentration of ligand and the specific receptor on which they act. Thus, {IR} and {IGF}1R act as identical portals to the regulation of gene expression, with differences between insulin and {IGF}-1 effects due to a modulation of the amplitude of the signal created by the specific ligand-receptor interaction.},

Defining the role of {PI}3K isoforms in insulin signaling is necessary for a mechanistic understanding of insulin action and to develop {PI}3K inhibitors with optimal therapeutic index. We show that insulin-driven {PI}3K-{AKT} signaling depends on redundant {PI}3Kα and {PI}3Kβ activities, whereas {PI}3Kδ and {PI}3Kγ are largely dispensable. We have also found that {RAS} activity promotes {AKT} phosphorylation in insulin-stimulated hepatocytes and that promotion of insulin-driven {AKT} phosphorylation by {RAS} depends on {PI}3Kα. These findings reveal the detailed mechanism by which insulin activates {AKT}, providing an improved mechanistic understanding of insulin signaling. This improved model for insulin signaling predicts that isoform-selective {PI}3K inhibitors discriminating between {PI}3Kα and {PI}3Kβ should be dosed below their hyperglycemic threshold to achieve isoform selectivity.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: {MicroRNAs} ({miRNAs}) are established regulators of development, cell identity and disease. Although nearly two thousand human {miRNA} genes are known and new ones are continuously discovered, no attempt has been made to gauge the total {miRNA} content of the human genome.
{RESULTS}: Employing an innovative computational method on massively pooled small {RNA} sequencing data, we report 2,469 novel human {miRNA} candidates of which 1,098 are validated by in-house and published experiments. Almost 300 candidates are robustly expressed in a neuronal cell system and are regulated during differentiation or when biogenesis factors Dicer, Drosha, {DGCR}8 or Ago2 are silenced. To improve expression profiling, we devised a quantitative {miRNA} capture system. In a kidney cell system, 400 candidates interact with {DGCR}8 at transcript positions that suggest {miRNA} hairpin recognition, and 1,000 of the new {miRNA} candidates interact with Ago1 or Ago2, indicating that they are directly bound by {miRNA} effector proteins. From kidney cell {CLASH} experiments, in which {miRNA}-target pairs are ligated and sequenced, we observe hundreds of interactions between novel {miRNAs} and {mRNA} targets. The novel {miRNA} candidates are specifically but lowly expressed, raising the possibility that not all may be functional. Interestingly, the majority are evolutionarily young and overrepresented in the human brain.
{CONCLUSIONS}: In summary, we present evidence that the complement of human {miRNA} genes is substantially larger than anticipated, and that more are likely to be discovered in the future as more tissues and experimental conditions are sequenced to greater depth.},

The achieved level of resolution in the reconstructed polyribosomes allowed deducing the {mRNA} path by connecting adjacent exit and entry sites at the ribosomes inside each polyribosome. In this way, the circularity of a significant fraction (about 50\%) of translating polyribosomes was proved in the case of the capped poly(A)-tailed {mRNA}, in agreement with the existing paradigm of the circularization via interaction of cap-bound initiation factor {eIF}4F with poly(A)-binding protein. However, translation of the capped {mRNA} construct without poly(A) tail, but with unspecific 3′-{UTR} derived from non-coding plasmid sequence, also led to the formation of circular polyribosomes in similar proportion (40\%). Moreover, the polyribosomes formed on the uncapped non-polyadenylated {mRNA} with non-synergistic 5′- and 3′-{UTRs} proved to be circular as well, and appeared in the same proportion as in the previous cases. Thus, the formation of circular polyribosomes was found to be virtually independent of the presence of cap structure and poly(A) tail in {mRNA}, in contrast to the longstanding paradigm in the field.},

Three distinct types of {AU}-rich {RNA} binding protein ({ARE} poly-U-binding degradation factor-1/{AUF}1, Hu antigen/{HuR}/{HuA}/{ELAVL}1, and the tristetraprolin/{ZFP}36 family of proteins) are essential for normal hematopoiesis.

	abstract = {An important paradigm for post-transcriptional regulation is the control of cytoplasmic {mRNA} stability mediated by {AU}-rich elements ({AREs}) in the 3? untranslated region of transcripts encoding oncoproteins, cytokines and transcription factors. While many {RNA}-binding proteins have been shown to bind to {AREs} in vitro, neither the functional consequences nor the physiological significance of their interactions are known. Here we demonstrate a role for the embryonic lethal abnormal visual ({ELAV}) {RNA}-binding protein {HuR} in {mRNA} turnover in vivo. The {ELAV} family of {RNA}-binding proteins is highly conserved in vertebrates. In humans, there are four members; {HuR} is expressed in all proliferating cells, whereas Hel-N1, {HuC} and {HuD} are expressed in terminally differentiated neurons. We show that elevation of cytoplasmic {HuR} levels inhibits c-fos {ARE}-mediated {RNA} decay but has little effect on rapid decay directed by c-jun {ARE}. It appears that {HuR} has little effect on deadenylation but delays onset of decay of the {RNA} body and slows down its subsequent decay. We also show that {HuR} can be induced to redistribute from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and that this redistribution is associated with an altered function. Modulation of the {ARE}-mediated decay pathway through controlling distribution of the {ELAV} proteins between nucleus and cytoplasm may be a mechanism by which cell growth and differentiation is regulated.},

	abstract = {The messenger {RNAs} of many proto-oncogenes, cytokines and lymphokines are targeted for rapid degradation through {AU}-rich elements ({AREs}) located in their 3? untranslated regions ({UTRs}). {HuR}, a ubiquitously expressed member of the Elav family of {RNA} binding proteins, exhibits specific affinities for {ARE}-containing {RNA} sequences in vitro which correlate with their in vivo decay rates, thereby implicating {HuR} in the {ARE}-mediated degradation pathway. We have transiently transfected {HuR} into mouse L929 cells and observed that overexpression of {HuR} enhances the stability of ?-globin reporter {mRNAs} containing either class I or class {II} {AREs}. The increase in {mRNA} stability parallels the level of {HuR} overexpression, establishing an in vivo role for {HuR} in {mRNA} decay. Furthermore, overexpression of {HuR} deletion mutants lacking {RNA} recognition motif 3 ({RRM} 3) does not exert a stabilizing effect, indicating that {RRM} 3 is important for {HuR} function. We have also developed polyclonal anti-{HuR} antibodies. Immunofluorescent staining of {HeLa} and L929 cells using affinity-purified anti-{HuR} antibody shows that both endogenous and overexpressed {HuR} proteins are localized in the nucleus. By forming {HeLa}?L929 cell heterokaryons, we demonstrate that {HuR} shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Thus, {HuR} may initially bind to {ARE}-containing {mRNAs} in the nucleus and provide protection during and after their export to the cytoplasmic compartment.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The human {ELAV} (embryonic lethal abnormal vision)-like protein {HuR} stabilizes a certain group of cellular {mRNAs} that contain {AU}-rich elements in their 3′-untranslated region. Cell culture studies have shown that the {mRNA} of cyclooxygenase ({COX})-2 can be stabilized by {HuR}.
Experimental Design: To investigate a possible contribution of dysregulation of {mRNA} stability to the progression of cancer and to overexpression of {COX}-2, we studied expression of {HuR} in 208 primary breast carcinomas by immunohistochemistry.
Results: There were two different staining patterns of {HuR} in tumor tissue of breast carcinomas: nuclear expression was seen in 61\% of cases; and an additional cytoplasmic expression was seen in 30\% of cases. Expression of {HuR} was significantly associated with increased {COX}-2 expression; this association was particularly significant for cytoplasmic {HuR} expression (P {\textless} 0.0005). We further observed a significant association of cytoplasmic (P = 0.002) or nuclear {HuR} (P = 0.027) expression with increased tumor grade. Only 13\% of the grade 1 carcinomas showed cytoplasmic expression of {HuR}, compared with 46\% of the grade 3 carcinomas. There was no significant correlation between {HuR} expression and other clinicopathological parameters such as histological type, tumor size, or nodal status as well as patient survival.
Conclusions: Our results suggest that overexpression of {HuR} in tumor tissue may be part of a regulatory pathway that controls the {mRNA} stability of several important targets in tumor biology, such as {COX}-2. Based on our results, additional studies are necessary to investigate whether {HuR} might be a potential target for molecular tumor therapy.},

Using {APEX}, we demonstrate that 73\% of the variance in yeast protein abundance (47\% in E. coli) is explained by {mRNA} abundance, with the number of proteins per {mRNA} log-normally distributed about ∼5,600 (∼540 in E. coli) protein molecules/{mRNA}.

	abstract = {The synthesis of many mammalian proteins associated with the translational apparatus is selectively regulated by mitogenic and nutritional stimuli, at the translational level. The apparent advantages of the regulation of gene expression at the translational level are the speed and the readily reversible nature of the response to altering physiological conditions. These two features enable cells to rapidly repress the biosynthesis of the translational machinery upon shortage of amino acids or growth arrest, thus rapidly blocking unnecessary energy wastage. Likewise, when amino acids are replenished or mitogenic stimulation is applied, then cells can rapidly respond in resuming the costly biosynthesis of the translational apparatus. A structural hallmark, common to {mRNAs} encoding many components of the translational machinery, is the presence of a 5’ terminal oligopyrimidine tract (5’{TOP}), referred to as {TOP} {mRNAs}. This structural motif comprises the core of the translational cis-regulatory element of these {mRNAs}. The present review focuses on the mechanism underlying the translational control of {TOP} {mRNAs} upon growth and nutritional stimuli. A special emphasis is put on the pivotal role played by ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) in this mode of regulation, and the upstream regulatory pathways, which might be engaged in transducing external signals into activation of S6K. Finally, the possible involvement of pyrimidine-binding proteins in the translational control of {TOP} {mRNAs} is discussed.},

Here, we develop a method for inferring translation elongation kinetics from ribosome profiling data using recent advances in mathematical modelling of {mRNA} translation. Our method distinguishes between the elongation rate intrinsic to the ribosome’s stepping cycle and the actual elongation rate that takes into account ribosome interference. This distinction allows us to quantify the extent of ribosomal collisions along the transcript and identify individual codons where ribosomal collisions are likely. When examining ribosome profiling in yeast, we observe that translation initiation and elongation are close to their optima and traffic is minimized at the beginning of the transcript to favour ribosome recruitment. However, we find many individual sites of congestion along the {mRNAs} where the probability of ribosome interference can reach \$50{\textbackslash}\%\$. Our work provides new measures of translation initiation and elongation efficiencies, emphasizing the importance of rating these two stages of translation separately.},

Correspondingly, we found that genes serving cell-autonomous functions and genes involved in multicellularity obey distinct codon usage. Proliferation-induced and differentiation-induced {tRNAs} often carry anticodons that correspond to the codons enriched among the cell-autonomous and the multicellularity genes, respectively. Because {mRNAs} of cell-autonomous genes are induced in proliferation and cancer in particular, the concomitant induction of their codon-enriched {tRNAs} suggests coordination between transcription and translation. Histone modifications indeed change similarly in the vicinity of cell-autonomous genes and their corresponding {tRNAs}, and in multicellularity genes and their {tRNAs}, suggesting the existence of transcriptional programs coordinating {tRNA} supply and demand. Hence, we describe the existence of two distinct translation programs that operate during proliferation and differentiation.},

In particular we present analytic expressions to describe the following three cases: (a) translation of a newly transcribed {mRNA}, (b) translation in the steady state and, specifically the dynamics of individual (tagged) ribosomes and (c) run-off translation after inhibition of translation initiation. In the cases (b) and (c) we develop an effective medium approximation to describe many-ribosome dynamics in terms of a single tagged ribosome in an effective medium.

	abstract = {Whether codon usage fine-tunes {mRNA} translation in mammals remains controversial, with recent papers suggesting that production of proteins in specific Gene Ontological ({GO}) pathways can be regulated by actively modifying the codon and anticodon pools in different cellular conditions. In this work, we compared the sequence content of genes in specific {GO} categories with the exonic genome background. Although a substantial fraction of variability in codon usage could be explained by random sampling, almost half of {GO} sets showed more variability in codon usage than expected by chance. Nevertheless, by quantifying translational efficiency in healthy and cancerous tissues in human and mouse, we demonstrated that a given {tRNA} pool can equally well translate many different sets of {mRNAs}, irrespective of their cell-type specificity. This disconnect between variations in codon usage and the stability of translational efficiency is best explained by differences in {GC} content between gene sets. {GC} variation across the mammalian genome is most likely a result of the interplay between genome repair and gene duplication mechanisms, rather than selective pressures caused by codon-driven translational rates. Consequently, codon usage differences in mammalian transcriptomes are most easily explained by well-understood mutational biases acting on the underlying genome.},

By analyzing the expression levels of {tRNAs} at the gene, codon, and amino acid levels, we identified unequal alterations in {tRNA} expression, likely due to the uneven distribution of {tRNAs} decoding different codons. We find that overexpression of {tRNAs} recognizing codons with a low observed-over-expected ratio may overcome the translational bottleneck in tumorigenesis. We further observed overall overexpression and amplification of {tRNA} modification enzymes, aminoacyl-{tRNA} synthetases, and translation factors, which may play synergistic roles with overexpression of {tRNAs} to activate the translational systems across multiple cancer types.},

However, the codon?anticodon co-adaptation in humans is not completely understood, nor is its effect on tissue-specific protein levels. Here, we first validated the accuracy of small {RNA}-seq for {tRNA} quantification across five human cell lines. We then analyzed the {tRNA} abundance of more than 8,000 tumor samples from {TCGA}, together with their paired {mRNA}-seq and proteomics data, to determine the Supply-to-Demand Adaptation. We thereby elucidate that the dynamic adaptation of the {tRNA} pool is largely related to the proliferative state across tissues. The distribution of such {tRNA} pools over the whole cellular translatome affects the subsequent translational efficiency, which functionally determines a condition-specific expression program both in healthy and tumor states. Furthermore, the aberrant translational efficiency of some codons in cancer, exemplified by {ProCCA} and {GlyGGT}, is associated with poor patient survival. The regulation of these {tRNA} profiles is partly explained by the {tRNA} gene copy numbers and their promoter {DNA} methylation.},

However, the extent to which they determine global protein production remains poorly understood. Here we use quantitative proteomics to show a direct link between wobble uridine 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl (mcm5) and 5-methoxy-carbonyl-methyl-2-thio (mcm5s2) modifications catalyzed by {tRNA} methyltransferase 9 (Trm9) in {tRNAArg}({UCU}) and {tRNAGlu}({UUC}) and selective translation of proteins from genes enriched with their cognate codons. Controlling for bias in protein expression and alternations in {mRNA} expression, we find that loss of Trm9 selectively impairs expression of proteins from genes enriched with {AGA} and {GAA} codons under both normal and stress conditions. Moreover, we show that {AGA} and {GAA} codons occur with high frequency in clusters along the transcripts, which may play a role in modulating translation. Consistent with these results, proteins subject to enhanced ribosome pausing in yeast lacking mcm5U and mcm5s2U are more likely to be down-regulated and contain a larger number of {AGA}/{GAA} clusters. Together, these results suggest that Trm9-catalyzed {tRNA} modifications play a significant role in regulating protein expression within the cell.},

Mutations in the homologous human genes are linked to neurological disease. The yeast phenotypes can be ameliorated by overexpression of specific {tRNAs}, suggesting that the modifications are necessary for efficient translation of specific codons. We determined the in vivo ribosome distributions at single codon resolution in yeast strains lacking mcm5s2U. We found accumulations at {AAA}, {CAA}, and {GAA} codons, suggesting that translation is slow when these codons are in the ribosomal A site, but these changes appeared too small to affect protein output. Instead, we observed activation of the {GCN}4-mediated stress response by a non-canonical pathway.

	abstract = {Proteins begin to fold as they emerge from translating ribosomes. The kinetics of ribosome transit along a given {mRNA} can influence nascent chain folding, but the extent to which individual codon translation rates impact proteome integrity remains unknown. Here, we show that slower decoding of discrete codons elicits widespread protein aggregation in vivo. Using ribosome profiling, we find that loss of anticodon wobble uridine (U34) modifications in a subset of {tRNAs} leads to ribosome pausing at their cognate codons in S. cerevisiae and C. elegans. Cells lacking U34 modifications exhibit gene expression hallmarks of proteotoxic stress, accumulate aggregates of endogenous proteins, and are severely compromised in clearing stress-induced protein aggregates. Overexpression of hypomodified {tRNAs} alleviates ribosome pausing, concomitantly restoring protein homeostasis. Our findings demonstrate that modified U34 is an evolutionarily conserved accelerator of decoding and reveal an unanticipated role for {tRNA} modifications in maintaining proteome integrity.},

	abstract = {Tumor initiation in the intestine can rapidly occur from Lgr5(+) crypt columnar stem cells. Dclk1 is a marker of differentiated Tuft cells and, when coexpressed with Lgr5, also marks intestinal cancer stem cells. Here, we show that Elp3, the catalytic subunit of the Elongator complex, is required for Wnt-driven intestinal tumor initiation and radiation-induced regeneration by maintaining a subpool of Lgr5(+)/Dclk1(+)/Sox9(+) cells. Elp3 deficiency dramatically delayed tumor appearance in Apc-mutated intestinal epithelia and greatly prolonged mice survival without affecting the normal epithelium. Specific ablation of Elp3 in Lgr5(+) cells resulted in marked reduction of polyp formation upon Apc inactivation, in part due to a decreased number of Lgr5(+)/Dclk1(+)/Sox9(+) cells. Mechanistically, Elp3 is induced by Wnt signaling and promotes Sox9 translation, which is needed to maintain the subpool of Lgr5(+)/Dclk1(+) cancer stem cells. Consequently, Elp3 or Sox9 depletion led to similar defects in Dclk1(+) cancer stem cells in ex vivo organoids. Finally, Elp3 deficiency strongly impaired radiation-induced intestinal regeneration, in part because of decreased Sox9 protein levels. Together, our data demonstrate the crucial role of Elp3 in maintaining a subpopulation of Lgr5-derived and Sox9-expressing cells needed to trigger Wnt-driven tumor initiation in the intestine.},

Posttranscriptional modifications of transfer {RNAs} ({tRNAs}) at the wobble uridine 34 (U34) base are highly conserved and contribute to translation fidelity. Here, we show that {ELP}3 and {CTU}1/2, partner enzymes in U34 mcm5s2-{tRNA} modification, are up-regulated in human breast cancers and sustain metastasis. Elp3 genetic ablation strongly impaired invasion and metastasis formation in the {PyMT} model of invasive breast cancer. Mechanistically, {ELP}3 and {CTU}1/2 support cellular invasion through the translation of the oncoprotein {DEK}. As a result, {DEK} promotes the {IRES}-dependent translation of the proinvasive transcription factor {LEF}1. Consistently, a {DEK} mutant, whose codon composition is independent of U34 mcm5s2-{tRNA} modification, escapes the {ELP}3- and {CTU}1-dependent regulation and restores the {IRES}-dependent {LEF}1 expression. Our results demonstrate that the key role of U34 {tRNA} modification is to support specific translation during breast cancer progression and highlight a functional link between {tRNA} modification– and {IRES}-dependent translation during tumor cell invasion and metastasis.},

The number of {tRNA} genes are between 170 and 570 and the number of {tRNA} isoacceptors range from 41 to 55. Unexpectedly, the number of {tRNA} genes having the same anticodon but different sequences elsewhere in the {tRNA} body (defined here as {tRNA} isodecoder genes) varies significantly (10–246). {tRNA} isodecoder genes allow up to 274 different {tRNA} species to be produced from 446 genes in humans, but only up to 51 from 275 genes in the budding yeast. The fraction of {tRNA} isodecoder genes among all {tRNA} genes increases across the phylogenetic spectrum. A large number of sequence differences in human {tRNA} isodecoder genes occurs in the internal promoter regions for {RNA} polymerase {III}. We also describe a systematic, ligation-based method to detect and quantify {tRNA} isodecoder molecules in human samples, and show differential expression of three {tRNA} isodecoders in six human tissues. The large number of {tRNA} isodecoder genes in eukaryotes suggests that {tRNA} function may be more diverse than previously appreciated.},

We used this technique to monitor translation in budding yeast under both rich and starvation conditions. These studies defined the protein sequences being translated and found extensive translational control in both determining absolute protein abundance and responding to environmental stress. We also observed distinct phases during translation that involve a large decrease in ribosome density going from early to late peptide elongation as well as widespread regulated initiation at non-adenine-uracil-guanine ({AUG}) codons. Ribosome profiling is readily adaptable to other organisms, making high-precision investigation of protein translation experimentally accessible.},

Here we report an analysis of the co-evolution of translatomes and transcriptomes using ribosome-profiling and matched {RNA}-sequencing data for three organs (brain, liver and testis) in five mammals (human, macaque, mouse, opossum and platypus) and a bird (chicken). Our within-species analyses reveal that translational regulation is widespread in the different organs, in particular across the spermatogenic cell types of the testis. The between-species divergence in gene expression is around 20\% lower at the translatome layer than at the transcriptome layer owing to extensive buffering between the expression layers, which especially preserved old, essential and housekeeping genes. Translational upregulation specifically counterbalanced global dosage reductions during the evolution of sex chromosomes and the effects of meiotic sex-chromosome inactivation during spermatogenesis. Despite the overall prevalence of buffering, some genes evolved faster at the translatome layer—potentially indicating adaptive changes in expression; testis tissue shows the highest fraction of such genes. Further analyses incorporating mass spectrometry proteomics data establish that the co-evolution of transcriptomes and translatomes is reflected at the proteome layer. Together, our work uncovers co-evolutionary patterns and associated selective forces across the expression layers, and provides a resource for understanding their interplay in mammalian organs.},

Hence surprisingly, a recent study showed that abundances of orthologous nematode and fly proteins correlate better than their corresponding {mRNA} abundances. We tested if this phenomenon is general by collecting and testing matching large-scale protein and {mRNA} expression data sets from seven different species: two bacteria, yeast, nematode, fly, human, and rice. We find that steady-state abundances of proteins show significantly higher correlation across these diverse phylogenetic taxa than the abundances of their corresponding {mRNAs} (p=0.0008, paired Wilcoxon).

	abstract = {{PURPOSE}: Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase ({PI}3K)-{AKT} pathway, resulting in increased cell proliferation, survival, and motility, is believed to play an oncogenic role in many cancer types. The {PIK}3CA gene encodes the p110alpha catalytic subunit of {PI}3K, and is amplified in some ovarian cancers, whereas the {AKT}2 gene is amplified in some ovarian, breast, and pancreatic cancers. Recently, in a mutational screen of eight {PI}3K genes and eight {PI}3K-like genes, {PIK}3CA was found to be the only gene affected by somatic mutations, which were observed frequently in gastrointestinal and brain cancers. Here, we test whether {PIK}3CA is subject to mutation in ovarian and breast cancers.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: Exons 9 and 20, encoding the highly conserved helical and kinase domains of {PIK}3CA, were subjected to sequence analysis in 198 advanced stage epithelial ovarian carcinomas and 72 invasive breast carcinomas (48 of ductal histology and 24 of lobular histology).
{RESULTS}: Somatic missense mutations were observed in 24 of 198 (12\%) ovarian carcinomas, and in 13 of 72 (18\%) breast carcinomas.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These data indicate that mutations of {PIK}3CA play an oncogenic role in substantial fractions of ovarian and breast carcinomas, and in consideration of mutation of other components of the {PI}3K-{AKT} pathway in both tumor types, confirm the major oncogenic role of this pathway in ovarian and breast carcinomas.},

Here, we performed mutational analysis of the {PIK}3CA gene by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism assay in 668 cases of common human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinomas, acute leukemias, gastric carcinomas, breast carcinomas, and non-small-cell lung cancers.

In vitro, glycolysis analysis, extracellular acidification rate analysis, and {ATP} production were used to evaluate the impact of {PIK}3CA E542K and E545K mutations on glucose metabolism. The expression level of key glycolytic enzymes was evaluated by western blotting and immunohistochemical staining in cervical cancer cells and tumor tissues, respectively. Immunofluorescence analysis was used to observe the nuclear translocation of β-catenin. The target gene of β-catenin was analyzed by using luciferase reporter system. The glucose metabolic ability of the xenograft models was assessed by {SUVmax} from {microPET}/{CT} scanning.
{RESULTS}: Cervical cancer patients with mutant {PIK}3CA (E542K and E545K) exhibited a higher {SUVmax} value than those with wild-type {PIK}3CA (P = 0.037), which was confirmed in xenograft models. In vitro, enhanced glucose metabolism and proliferation was observed in {SiHa} and {MS}751 cells with mutant {PIK}3CA. The {mRNA} and protein expression of key glycolytic enzymes was increased. {AKT}/{GSK}3β/β-catenin signaling was highly activated in {SiHa} and {MS}751 cells with mutant {PIK}3CA. Knocking down β-catenin expression decreased glucose uptake and lactate production. In addition, the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin was found in {SiHa} cells and tumors with mutant {PIK}3CA. Furthermore, β-catenin downregulated the expression of {SIRT}3 via suppressing the activity of the {SIRT}3 promotor, and the reduced glucose uptake and lactate production due to the downregulation of β-catenin can be reversed by the transfection of {SIRT}3 {siRNA} in {SiHa} cells with mutant {PIK}3CA. The negative correlation between β-catenin and {SIRT}3 was further confirmed in cervical cancer tissues.
{CONCLUSIONS}: These findings provide evidence that the {PI}3K E542K and E545K/β-catenin/{SIRT}3 signaling axis regulates glucose metabolism and proliferation in cervical cancers with {PIK}3CA mutations, suggesting therapeutic targets in the treatment of cervical cancers.

We find that the Rag proteins—a family of four related small guanosine triphosphatases ({GTPases})—interact with {mTORC}1 in an amino acid–sensitive manner and are necessary for the activation of the {mTORC}1 pathway by amino acids. A Rag mutant that is constitutively bound to guanosine triphosphate interacted strongly with {mTORC}1, and its expression within cells made the {mTORC}1 pathway resistant to amino acid deprivation. Conversely, expression of a guanosine diphosphate–bound Rag mutant prevented stimulation of {mTORC}1 by amino acids. The Rag proteins do not directly stimulate the kinase activity of {mTORC}1, but, like amino acids, promote the intracellular localization of {mTOR} to a compartment that also contains its activator Rheb.
Nutrients, specifically amino acids, are sensed by small guanosine triphosphatases, which bind to a signaling complex, moving it close to the nucleus where it initiates cell growth.

Akt/{PKB} activation requires the phosphorylation of Thr308 in the activation loop by the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 ({PDK}1) and Ser473 within the carboxyl-terminal hydrophobic motif by an unknown kinase. We show that in Drosophila and human cells the target of rapamycin ({TOR}) kinase and its associated protein rictor are necessary for Ser473 phosphorylation and that a reduction in rictor or mammalian {TOR} ({mTOR}) expression inhibited an Akt/{PKB} effector. The rictor-{mTOR} complex directly phosphorylated Akt/{PKB} on Ser473 in vitro and facilitated Thr308 phosphorylation by {PDK}1. Rictor-{mTOR} may serve as a drug target in tumors that have lost the expression of {PTEN}, a tumor suppressor that opposes Akt/{PKB} activation.

The mechanism of protein synthesis inhibition by hypoxia and its circumvention by transformation are not well understood. Hypoxic breast epithelial cells are shown to downregulate protein synthesis by inhibition of the kinase {mTOR}, which suppresses {mRNA} translation through a novel mechanism mitigated in transformed cells: disruption of proteasome-targeted degradation of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 ({eEF}2) kinase and activation of the regulatory protein 4E-{BP}1. In transformed breast epithelial cells under hypoxia, the {mTOR} and S6 kinases are constitutively activated and the {mTOR} negative regulator tuberous sclerosis complex 2 ({TSC}2) protein fails to function. Gene silencing of 4E-{BP}1 and {eEF}2 kinase or {TSC}2 confers resistance to hypoxia inhibition of protein synthesis in immortalized breast epithelial cells. Breast cancer cells therefore acquire resistance to hypoxia by uncoupling oxygen-responsive signaling pathways from {mTOR} function, eliminating inhibition of protein synthesis mediated by 4E-{BP}1 and {eEF}2.},

	abstract = {The conserved serine/threonine kinase {mTOR} (the mammalian target of rapamycin), a downstream effector of the {PI}3K/{AKT} pathway, forms two distinct multiprotein complexes: {mTORC}1 and {mTORC}2. {mTORC}1 is sensitive to rapamycin, activates S6K1 and 4EBP1, which are involved in {mRNA} translation. It is activated by diverse stimuli, such as growth factors, nutrients, energy and stress signals, and essential signalling pathways, such as {PI}3K, {MAPK} and {AMPK}, in order to control cell growth, proliferation and survival. {mTORC}2 is considered resistant to rapamycin and is generally insensitive to nutrients and energy signals. It activates {PKC}-α and {AKT} and regulates the actin cytoskeleton. Deregulation of multiple elements of the {mTOR} pathway ({PI}3K amplification/mutation, {PTEN} loss of function, {AKT} overexpression, and S6K1, 4EBP1 and {eIF}4E overexpression) has been reported in many types of cancers, particularly in melanoma, where alterations in major components of the {mTOR} pathway were reported to have significant effects on tumour progression. Therefore, {mTOR} is an appealing therapeutic target and {mTOR} inhibitors, including the rapamycin analogues deforolimus, everolimus and temsirolimus, are submitted to clinical trials for treating multiple cancers, alone or in combination with inhibitors of other pathways. Importantly, temsirolimus and everolimus were recently approved by the {FDA} for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, {PNET} and giant cell astrocytoma. Small molecules that inhibit {mTOR} kinase activity and dual {PI}3K-{mTOR} inhibitors are also being developed. In this review, we aim to survey relevant research, the molecular mechanisms of signalling, including upstream activation and downstream effectors, and the role of {mTOR} in cancer, mainly in melanoma.},

{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: A 3-day loading dose, then weekly maintenance doses, were given to 1 to 3 patient cohorts, beginning with 100 mg and escalating. Plasma samples were collected to determine {LY}2275796 concentrations and tumor biopsies to quantify {eIF}-4E {mRNA}/protein.
{RESULTS}: Thirty patients with stage 4 disease received 1 or more {LY}2275796 dose. A dose-limiting toxicity was observed at 1,200 mg, with 1,000 mg the maximum-tolerated dose. Across all dose levels, most patients (87\%) had only grade 1 to 2 toxicities. {LY}2275796 pharmacokinetics supported the dosing regimen. Comparison of pre- and postdose biopsies showed {eIF}-4E decreased in most patients. Fifteen patients had progressive disease, and 7 patients achieved stable disease (minimum of 6 weeks) as best response, with 2 patients on therapy for more than 3 months (one with melanoma, one with cystadenocarcinoma of the head/neck).
{CONCLUSIONS}: {LY}2275796 was well tolerated up to 1,000 mg. Because tumor {eIF}-4E expression was decreased, but no tumor response observed, {LY}2275796 should be studied combined with other treatment modalities.},

In response to mitogens, {PDCD}4 was rapidly phosphorylated on Ser67 by the protein kinase S6K1 and subsequently degraded via the ubiquitin ligase {SCFβTRCP}. Expression in cultured cells of a stable {PDCD}4 mutant that is unable to bind β{TRCP} inhibited translation of an {mRNA} with a structured 5′{UTR}, resulted in smaller cell size, and slowed down cell cycle progression.

	abstract = {Summary: High-throughput technologies have led to an explosion of genomic data available for automated analysis. The consequent possibility to simultaneously sample multiple layers of variation along the gene expression flow requires computational methods integrating raw information from different ‘-omics’. It has been recently demonstrated that translational control is a widespread phenomenon, with profound and still underestimated regulation capabilities. Although detecting changes in the levels of total messenger {RNAs} ({mRNAs}; the transcriptome), of polysomally loaded {mRNAs} (the translatome) and of proteins (the proteome) is experimentally feasible in a high-throughput way, the integration of these levels is still far from being robustly approached. Here we introduce {tRanslatome}, a new R/Bioconductor package, which is a complete platform for the simultaneous pairwise analysis of transcriptome, translatome and proteome data. The package includes most of the available statistical methods developed for the analysis of high-throughput data, allowing the parallel comparison of differentially expressed genes and the corresponding differentially enriched biological themes. Notably, it also enables the prediction of translational regulatory elements on {mRNA} sequences. The utility of this tool is demonstrated with two case studies., Availability and implementation: {tRanslatome} is available in Bioconductor., Contact: t.tebaldi@unitn.it, Supplementary information:

	abstract = {The benefit of integrating batches of genomic data to increase statistical power is often hindered by batch effects, or unwanted variation in data caused by differences in technical factors across batches. It is therefore critical to effectively address batch effects in genomic data to overcome these challenges. Many existing methods for batch effects adjustment assume the data follow a continuous, bell-shaped Gaussian distribution. However in {RNA}-seq studies the data are typically skewed, over-dispersed counts, so this assumption is not appropriate and may lead to erroneous results. Negative binomial regression models have been used previously to better capture the properties of counts. We developed a batch correction method, {ComBat}-seq, using a negative binomial regression model that retains the integer nature of count data in {RNA}-seq studies, making the batch adjusted data compatible with common differential expression software packages that require integer counts. We show in realistic simulations that the {ComBat}-seq adjusted data results in better statistical power and control of false positives in differential expression compared to data adjusted by the other available methods. We further demonstrated in a real data example that {ComBat}-seq successfully removes batch effects and recovers the biological signal in the data.},

	abstract = {Non-biological experimental variation or "batch effects" are commonly observed across multiple batches of microarray experiments, often rendering the task of combining data from these batches difficult. The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( {\textgreater} 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

These sources of noise must be modeled and removed to accurately measure biological variability and to obtain correct statistical inference when performing high-throughput genomic analysis. We introduced surrogate variable analysis (sva) for estimating these artifacts by (i) identifying the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts and (ii) estimating the artifacts with principal components or singular vectors of the subset of the data matrix. The resulting estimates of artifacts can be used in subsequent analyses as adjustment factors to correct analyses. Here I describe a version of the sva approach specifically created for count data or {FPKMs} from sequencing experiments based on appropriate data transformation. I also describe the addition of supervised sva (ssva) for using control probes to identify the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts.

	abstract = {The mechanisms that govern organelle adaptation and remodelling remain poorly defined. The endo-lysosomal system degrades cargo from various routes, including endocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy. For phagocytes, endosomes and lysosomes (endo-lysosomes) are kingpin organelles because they are essential to kill pathogens and process and present antigens. During phagocyte activation, endo-lysosomes undergo a morphological transformation, going from a collection of dozens of globular structures to a tubular network in a process that requires the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-{AKT}-mechanistic target of rapamycin ({mTOR}) signalling pathway. Here, we show that the endo-lysosomal system undergoes an expansion in volume and holding capacity during phagocyte activation within 2 h of lipopolysaccharides ({LPS}) stimulation. Endo-lysosomal expansion was paralleled by an increase in lysosomal protein levels, but this was unexpectedly largely independent of the transcription factor {EB} ({TFEB}) and transcription factor E3 ({TFE}3), which are known to scale up lysosome biogenesis. Instead, we demonstrate a hitherto unappreciated mechanism of acute organelle expansion via {mTOR} Complex 1 ({mTORC}1)-dependent increase in translation, which appears to be mediated by both S6Ks and 4E-{BPs}. Moreover, we show that stimulation of {RAW} 264.7 macrophage cell line with {LPS} alters translation of a subset but not all of {mRNAs} encoding endo-lysosomal proteins, thereby suggesting that endo-lysosome expansion is accompanied by functional remodelling. Importantly, {mTORC}1-dependent increase in translation activity was necessary for efficient and rapid antigen presentation by dendritic cells. Collectively, we identified a previously unknown and functionally relevant mechanism for endo-lysosome expansion that relies on {mTORC}1-dependent translation to stimulate endo-lysosome biogenesis in response to an infection signal.},

	abstract = {The protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani (L. donovani) causes visceral leishmaniasis, a chronic infection which is fatal when untreated. Herein, we investigated whether in addition to altering transcription, L. donovani modulates host {mRNA} translation to establish a successful infection. Polysome-profiling revealed that one third of protein-coding {mRNAs} expressed in primary mouse macrophages are differentially translated upon infection with L. donovani promastigotes or amastigotes. Gene ontology analysis identified key biological processes enriched for translationally regulated {mRNAs} and were predicted to be either activated (e.g. chromatin remodeling and {RNA} metabolism) or inhibited (e.g. intracellular trafficking and antigen presentation) upon infection. Mechanistic in silico and biochemical analyses showed selective activation {mTOR}- and {eIF}4A-dependent {mRNA} translation, including transcripts encoding central regulators of {mRNA} turnover and inflammation (i.e. {PABPC}1, {EIF}2AK2, and {TGF}-β). L. donovani survival within macrophages was favored under {mTOR} inhibition but was dampened by pharmacological blockade of {eIF}4A. Overall, this study uncovers a vast yet selective reprogramming of the host cell translational landscape early during L. donovani infection, and suggests that some of these changes are involved in host defense mechanisms while others are part of parasite-driven survival strategies. Further in vitro and in vivo investigation will shed light on the contribution of {mTOR}- and {eIF}4A-dependent translational programs to the outcome of visceral leishmaniasis.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Recent evidence suggests that noninvasive precursor lesions, classified as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia ({PanIN}), can progress to invasive pancreatic cancer. This review will discuss the major genetic alterations in {PanIN} lesions.
{METHODS}: A comprehensive review of the literature was performed in order to find studies on the molecular profile of human {PanIN} lesions. In addition, recent publications on genetically engineered mouse models of preinvasive neoplasia and pancreatic cancers were reviewed.
{RESULTS}: {PanINs} demonstrate abnormalities at the genomic ({DNA}), transcriptomic ({RNA}), and proteomic levels, and there is a progressive accumulation of molecular alterations that accompany the histological progression from low-grade {PanIN}-1A to high-grade {PanIN}-3 lesions. Molecular changes in {PanINs} can be classified as "early" ({KRAS}2 mutations, telomere shortening, p21({WAF}1/{CIP}1) up-regulation, etc.), "intermediate" (cyclin D1 up-regulation, expression of proliferation antigens, etc.), or "late" ({BRCA}2 and {TP}53 mutations, {DPC}4/{SMAD}4/{MADH}4 inactivation, etc.). All the genetic changes observed in {PanINs} are also found in invasive ductal adenocarcinomas, where they usually occur at a higher frequency. Genetically engineered mice expressing mutant Kras in the pancreas, with or without additional genetic alterations, provide a unique in vivo platform to study the pancreatic cancer progression model.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Molecular studies have been instrumental in establishing that {PanIN} lesions are the noninvasive precursors for invasive ductal adenocarcinomas. The availability of molecular date provides the basis for designing rational early detection strategies and therapeutic intervention trials before pancreatic neoplasms invade, with the intention of alleviating the dismal prognosis associated with this disease.},

	abstract = {Purpose
To improve on current standards for breast cancer prognosis and prediction of chemotherapy benefit by developing a risk model that incorporates the gene expression–based “intrinsic” subtypes luminal A, luminal B, {HER}2-enriched, and basal-like.

Methods
A 50-gene subtype predictor was developed using microarray and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction data from 189 prototype samples. Test sets from 761 patients (no systemic therapy) were evaluated for prognosis, and 133 patients were evaluated for prediction of pathologic complete response ({pCR}) to a taxane and anthracycline regimen.

Results
The intrinsic subtypes as discrete entities showed prognostic significance (P = 2.26E-12) and remained significant in multivariable analyses that incorporated standard parameters (estrogen receptor status, histologic grade, tumor size, and node status). A prognostic model for node-negative breast cancer was built using intrinsic subtype and clinical information. The C-index estimate for the combined model (subtype and tumor size) was a significant improvement on either the clinicopathologic model or subtype model alone. The intrinsic subtype model predicted neoadjuvant chemotherapy efficacy with a negative predictive value for {pCR} of 97\%.

Conclusion
Diagnosis by intrinsic subtype adds significant prognostic and predictive information to standard parameters for patients with breast cancer. The prognostic properties of the continuous risk score will be of value for the management of node-negative breast cancers. The subtypes and risk score can also be used to assess the likelihood of efficacy from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.},

Compelling evidence now demonstrates that differences in the molecular pathology of otherwise indistinguishable cancers substantially impact the clinical characteristics of the disease. Molecular subtypes now guide preclinical and clinical therapeutic development and treatment in many cancer types. The ability to predict optimal therapeutic strategies ahead of treatment improves overall patient outcomes, minimizing treatment-related morbidity and cost. Although clinical decision making based on histopathological criteria underpinned by robust data is well established in many cancer types, subtypes of pancreatic cancer do not currently inform treatment decisions. However, accumulating molecular data are defining subgroups in pancreatic cancer with distinct biology and potential subtype-specific therapeutic vulnerabilities, providing the opportunity to define a de novo clinically applicable molecular taxonomy. This Review summarizes current knowledge concerning the molecular subtyping of pancreatic cancer and explores future strategies for using a molecular taxonomy to guide therapeutic development and ultimately routine therapy with the overall goal of improving outcomes for this disease.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND} \& {AIMS}: Genomic studies have revealed subtypes of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ({PDA}) based on their molecular features, but different studies have reported different classification systems. It is a challenge to obtain high-quality, freshly frozen tissue for clinical analysis and determination of {PDA} subtypes. We aimed to redefine subtypes of {PDA} using a large number of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded {PDA} samples, which are more amenable to routine clinical evaluation.
{METHODS}: We collected {PDA} samples from 309 consecutive patients who underwent surgery from September 1996 through December 2010 at 4 academic hospitals in Europe; nontumor tissue samples were not included. Samples were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. {DNA} and {RNA} were isolated; gene expression, targeted {DNA} sequencing, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed. We used independent component analysis to deconvolute normal, tumor, and microenvironment transcriptome patterns in samples. We devised classification systems from an unsupervised analysis using a consensus clustering approach of our data set after removing normal contamination components. We associated subtypes with overall survival and disease-free survival of patients using Cox proportional hazards regression with estimation of hazard ratios and 95\% confidence interval. We used The Cancer Genome Consortium and International Cancer Genome Consortium {PDA} data sets as validation cohorts.
{RESULTS}: We validated the previously reported basal-like and classical tumor-specific subtypes of {PDAs}. We identified features of the {PDA}, including microenvironment gene expression patterns, that allowed tumors to be categorized into 5 subtypes, called pure basal like, stroma activated, desmoplastic, pure classical, and immune classical. These {PDA} subtypes have features of cancer cells and immune cells that could be targeted by pharmacologic agents. Tumor subtypes were associated with patient outcomes, based on analysis of our data set and the International Cancer Genome Consortium and The Cancer Genome Consortium {PDA} data sets. We also observed an exocrine signal associated with acinar cell contamination (from pancreatic tissue).
{CONCLUSIONS}: We identified a classification system based on gene expression analysis of formalin-fixed {PDA} samples. We identified 5 {PDA} subtypes, based on features of cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. This system might be used to select therapies and predict patient outcomes. We found evidence that the previously reported exocrine-like (called {ADEX}) tumor subtype resulted from contamination with pancreatic acinar cells. {ArrayExpress} accession number: E-{MTAB}-6134.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ({PDA}) is a lethal disease. Overall survival is typically 6 months from diagnosis. Numerous phase 3 trials of agents effective in other malignancies have failed to benefit unselected {PDA} populations, although patients do occasionally respond. Studies in other solid tumors have shown that heterogeneity in response is determined, in part, by molecular differences between tumors. Furthermore, treatment outcomes are improved by targeting drugs to tumor subtypes in which they are selectively effective, with breast and lung cancers providing recent examples. Identification of {PDA} molecular subtypes has been frustrated by a paucity of tumor specimens available for study. We have overcome this problem by combined analysis of transcriptional profiles of primary {PDA} samples from several studies, along with human and mouse {PDA} cell lines. We define three {PDA} subtypes: classical, quasimesenchymal and exocrine-like, and we present evidence for clinical outcome and therapeutic response differences between them. We further define gene signatures for these subtypes that may have utility in stratifying patients for treatment and present preclinical model systems that may be used to identify new subtype specific therapies.},

By digitally separating tumor, stromal and normal gene expression, we have identified and validated two tumor subtypes, including a 'basal-like' subtype that has worse outcome and is molecularly similar to basal tumors in bladder and breast cancers. Furthermore, we define 'normal' and 'activated' stromal subtypes, which are independently prognostic.

	abstract = {There are currently few therapeutic options for patients with pancreatic cancer, and new insights into the pathogenesis of this lethal disease are urgently needed. Toward this end, we performed a comprehensive genetic analysis of 24 pancreatic cancers. We first determined the sequences of 23,219 transcripts, representing 20,661 protein-coding genes, in these samples. Then, we searched for homozygous deletions and amplifications in the tumor {DNA} by using microarrays containing probes for ∼106 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We found that pancreatic cancers contain an average of 63 genetic alterations, the majority of which are point mutations. These alterations defined a core set of 12 cellular signaling pathways and processes that were each genetically altered in 67 to 100\% of the tumors. Analysis of these tumors' transcriptomes with next-generation sequencing-by-synthesis technologies provided independent evidence for the importance of these pathways and processes. Our data indicate that genetically altered core pathways and regulatory processes only become evident once the coding regions of the genome are analyzed in depth. Dysregulation of these core pathways and processes through mutation can explain the major features of pancreatic tumorigenesis.
Sequencing of {DNA} mutations shows that the same 12 signaling pathways are disrupted in most pancreatic tumors, suggesting these as key to tumor development.

	abstract = {Background
Flavaglines are a family of natural products from the genus Aglaia that exhibit anti-cancer activity in vitro and in vivo and inhibit translation initiation. They have been shown to modulate the activity of {eIF}4A, the {DEAD}-box {RNA} helicase subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor ({eIF}) 4F complex, a complex that stimulates ribosome recruitment during translation initiation. One flavagline, silvestrol, is capable of modulating chemosensitivity in a mechanism-based mouse model.

Methodology/Principal Findings
Among a number of flavagline family members tested herein, we find that silvestrol is the more potent translation inhibitor among these. We find that silvestrol impairs the ribosome recruitment step of translation initiation by affecting the composition of the eukaryotic initiation factor ({eIF}) 4F complex. We show that silvestrol exhibits significant anticancer activity in human breast and prostate cancer xenograft models, and that this is associated with increased apoptosis, decreased proliferation, and inhibition of angiogenesis. We demonstrate that targeting translation by silvestrol results in preferential inhibition of weakly initiating {mRNAs}.

Conclusions/Significance
Our results indicate that silvestrol is a potent anti-cancer compound in vivo that exerts its activity by affecting survival pathways as well as angiogenesis. We propose that silvestrol mediates its effects by preferentially inhibiting translation of malignancy-related {mRNAs}. Silvestrol appears to be well tolerated in animals.},

	abstract = {l-Glutamine is a nutritionally semi-essential amino acid for proper growth in most cells and tissues, and plays an important role in the determination and guarding of the normal metabolic processes of the cells. With the help of transport systems, extracellular l-glutamine crosses the plasma membrane and is converted into alpha-ketoglutarate ({AKG}) through two pathways, namely, the glutaminase ({GLS}) I and {II} pathway. Reversely, {AKG} can be converted into glutamine by glutamate dehydrogenase ({GDH}) and glutamine synthetase ({GS}), or be converted into {CO}2 via the tricarboxylic acid ({TCA}) cycle and provide energy for the cells. Different steps of glutamine metabolism (the glutamine-{AKG} axis) are regulated by several factors, rendering the glutamine-{AKG} axis a potential target to counteract cancer. Moreover, intracellular glutamine plays an important role in cellular homeostasis not only as a precursor for protein synthesis, but also for its nutritional roles in cell growth, lipid metabolism, insulin secretion, and so on. The main objective of this review is to highlight the metabolic pathways of glutamine to {AKG}, with special emphasis on nutritional and therapeutic use of glutamine-{AKG} axis to improve the health and well-being of animals and humans.},

The oncogenic function of {eIF}4E is, however, antagonised by the hypophosphorylated forms of the inhibitory {eIF}4E-binding proteins 1 and 2. {eIF}4E-binding protein 1 and 2 (4E-{BP}1 and 2) are two major targets of the protein kinase {mTOR}, and are essential for the antiproliferative effects of {mTOR} inhibitors. Herein, we report that pancreas expresses specifically and massively 4E-{BP}1 (4E-{BP}2 is nearly undetectable). However, 4E-{BP}1 expression is extinguished in more than half of the human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas ({PDAC}). 4E-{BP}1 shutoff is recapitulated in a mouse genetic model of {PDAC}, which is based on a pancreas-specific mutation of Kras, the more frequently mutated oncogene in human pancreatic tumours. 4E-{BP}1 downregulation enhances {eIF}4E phosphorylation and facilitates pancreatic cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumour development in vivo. Furthermore, 4E-{BP}1 loss combined with the absence of 4E-{BP}2 renders {eIF}4E phosphorylation, protein synthesis and cell proliferation resistant to {mTOR} inhibition. However, proliferation can be better limited by a recently developed compound that mimics the function of 4E-{BP}1 and 2 independently of {mTOR} inhibition.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic adenocarcinoma ({PDAC}) epitomizes a deadly cancer driven by abnormal {KRAS} signalling. Here we show that the {eIF}4A {RNA} helicase is required for translation of key {KRAS} signaling molecules and that pharmacological inhibition of {eIF}4A has single-agent activity against murine and human {PDAC} models at safe dose levels. {EIF}4A was uniquely required for the translation of {mRNAs} with long and highly structured 5'{UTRs} including those with multiple G-quadruplex ({GQ}) elements. Computational analyses identified these features in {mRNAs} encoding {KRAS} and key downstream molecules. Transcriptome-scale ribosome footprinting accurately identified {eIF}4A-dependent {mRNAs} in {PDAC} including critical {KRAS} signaling molecules such as {PI}3K, {RALA}, {RAC}2, {MET}, {MYC}, and {YAP}1. These findings contrast with a recent study that relied on an older method, polysome fractionation, and implicated redox-related genes as {eIF}4A clients. Together, our findings highlight the power of ribosome footprinting in conjunction with deep {RNA} sequencing in accurately decoding translational control mechanisms and define the therapeutic mechanism of {eIF}4A inhibitors in {PDAC}.},

Consistently, human and mouse {PDAC} lose expression of the translational repressor and {mTOR} target 4E-{BP}1. Using genome-wide polysome profiling, we here explore {mRNAs} whose translational efficiencies depend on the {mTOR}/4E-{BP}1 axis in pancreatic cancer cells. We identified a functional enrichment for {mRNAs} encoding {DNA} replication and repair proteins, including {RRM}2 and {CDC}6. Consequently, 4E-{BP}1 depletion favors {DNA} repair and renders {DNA} replication insensitive to {mTOR} inhibitors, in correlation with a sustained protein expression of {CDC}6 and {RRM}2, which is inversely correlated with 4E-{BP}1 expression in {PDAC} patient samples. {DNA} damage and pancreatic lesions induced by an experimental pancreatitis model uncover that 4E-{BP}1/2-deleted mice display an increased acinar cell proliferation and a better recovery than {WT} animals. Targeting translation, independently of 4E-{BP}1 status, using {eIF}4A {RNA} helicase inhibitors (silvestrol derivatives) selectively modulates translation and limits {CDC}6 expression and {DNA} replication, leading to reduced {PDAC} tumor growth. In summary, 4E-{BP}1 expression loss during {PDAC} development induces selective changes in translation of {mRNA} encoding {DNA} replication and repair protein.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: The clinical impact of the biological heterogeneity within {HER}2-positive ({HER}2+) breast cancer is not fully understood. Here, we evaluated the molecular features and survival outcomes of the intrinsic subtypes within {HER}2+ breast cancer.
{METHODS}: We interrogated The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 495) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium ({METABRIC}) datasets (n = 1730) of primary breast cancers for molecular data derived from {DNA}, {RNA} and protein, and determined intrinsic subtype. Clinical {HER}2 status was defined according to American Society of Clinical Oncology ({ASCO})/College of American Pathologists ({CAP}) guidelines or {DNA} copy-number aberration by single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Cox models tested the prognostic significance of each variable in patients not treated with trastuzumab (n = 1711).
{RESULTS}: Compared with clinically {HER}2 ({cHER}2)-negative breast cancer, {cHER}2+ breast cancer had a higher frequency of the {HER}2-enriched ({HER}2E) subtype (47.0\% vs 7.1\%) and a lower frequency of Luminal A (10.7\% vs 39.0\%) and Basal-like (14.1\% vs 23.4\%) subtypes. The likelihood of {cHER}2-positivity in {HER}2E, Luminal B, Basal-like and Luminal A subtypes was 64.6\%, 20.0\%, 14.4\% and 7.3\%, respectively. Within each subtype, only 0.3\% to 3.9\% of genes were found differentially expressed between {cHER}2+ and {cHER}2-negative tumors. Within {cHER}2+ tumors, {HER}2 gene and protein expression was statistically significantly higher in the {HER}2E and Basal-like subtypes than either luminal subtype. Neither {cHER}2 status nor the new 10-subtype copy number-based classification system ({IntClust}) added independent prognostic value to intrinsic subtype.
{CONCLUSIONS}: When the intrinsic subtypes are taken into account, {cHER}2-positivity does not translate into large changes in the expression of downstream signaling pathways, nor does it affect patient survival in the absence of {HER}2 targeting.},

Much of the information accumulated in recent years, and molecular taxonomy seems to be still developing and undergoing change. The main question is whether new molecular techniques such as gene expression profiling will be accepted as gold standard in determining breast cancer subtypes, and whether molecular classification is useful in specific subtypes of breast cancer as it is in ductal carcinoma (nonspecific type). In addition, critical review of the literature reveals major problems such as poor definition, lack of reproducibility and lack of quality control in current molecular techniques and classifications.

	abstract = {Purpose of Review
Obesity is a recognized risk factor for the development of breast cancer and recurrence even when patients are treated appropriately. We reviewed the literature that addresses the impact of obesity on diagnosis and the individual therapeutic interventions, and present a summary of the findings.

Recent Findings
Compared to non-obese women with breast cancer, obese women with breast cancer have a worse disease-free and overall survival despite appropriate local and systemic therapies. In brief, obese breast cancer patients experience more complications related to surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Further, obese patients are at increased risk for local recurrence compared to normal-weight women. Similarly, systemic chemotherapy is less effective, even when dosed appropriately on the basis of actual weight. Overall, endocrine therapy is less effective in obese women, and there is a suggestion that aromatase inhibitors may be selectively less effective than tamoxifen. Obese women are less likely to undergo breast reconstruction than normal-weight women, and those who do have surgery experience more surgical complications.

Summary
The efficacy of cancer treatments is significantly lower in obese breast cancer survivors, posing greater challenges in patient care and disease management in this patient population. Further investigations are warranted to assess the effects on treatment outcomes and optimize therapeutic mechanisms in order to successfully target breast cancer associated with obesity.},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Annual updates on cancer occurrence and trends in the United States are provided through collaboration between the American Cancer Society ({ACS}), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ({CDC}), the National Cancer Institute ({NCI}), and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries ({NAACCR}). This year's report highlights the increased cancer risk associated with excess weight (overweight or obesity) and lack of sufficient physical activity ({\textless}150 minutes of physical activity per week).
{METHODS}: Data on cancer incidence were obtained from the {CDC}, {NCI}, and {NAACCR}; data on cancer deaths were obtained from the {CDC}'s National Center for Health Statistics. Annual percent changes in incidence and death rates (age-standardized to the 2000 {US} population) for all cancers combined and for the leading cancers among men and among women were estimated by joinpoint analysis of long-term trends (incidence for 1992-2008 and mortality for 1975-2008) and short-term trends (1999-2008). Information was obtained from national surveys about the proportion of {US} children, adolescents, and adults who are overweight, obese, insufficiently physically active, or physically inactive.
{RESULTS}: Death rates from all cancers combined decreased from 1999 to 2008, continuing a decline that began in the early 1990s, among men and among women in most racial and ethnic groups. Death rates decreased from 1999 to 2008 for most cancer sites, including the 4 most common cancers (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate). The incidence of prostate and colorectal cancers also decreased from 1999 to 2008. Lung cancer incidence declined from 1999 to 2008 among men and from 2004 to 2008 among women. Breast cancer incidence decreased from 1999 to 2004 but was stable from 2004 to 2008. Incidence increased for several cancers, including pancreas, kidney, and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, which are associated with excess weight.
{CONCLUSIONS}: Although improvements are reported in the {US} cancer burden, excess weight and lack of sufficient physical activity contribute to the increased incidence of many cancers, adversely affect quality of life for cancer survivors, and may worsen prognosis for several cancers. The current report highlights the importance of efforts to promote healthy weight and sufficient physical activity in reducing the cancer burden in the United States.},

	abstract = {Obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes are associated with cancer‐related mortality. We assessed whether hyperinsulinemia is a risk factor for cancer death in nonobese people without diabetes. We conducted a prospective cohort study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2010 and followed up the participants until December 31, 2011. For the primary analysis of cancer mortality, we used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate hazard ratios ({HRs}) in the participants with hyperinsulinemia and those without. Hyperinsulinemia was defined as a fasting insulin level of ≥10 μU/{mL}. To identify causes of deaths, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes were used. This study included 9,778 participants aged 20 years or older without diabetes or a history of cancer: 6,718 nonobese participants (2,057 with hyperinsulinemia [30.6\%]) and 3,060 obese participants (2,303 with hyperinsulinemia [75.3\%]). A total of 99.9\% completed follow‐up. Among all study participants, cancer mortality was significantly higher in those with hyperinsulinemia than in those without hyperinsulinemia (adjusted {HR} 2.04, 95\% {CI} 1.24–3.34, p = 0.005). Similarly, among nonobese participants, multivariable analysis showed that cancer mortality was significantly higher in those with hyperinsulinemia than in those without (adjusted {HR} 1.89, 95\% {CI} 1.07–3.35, p = 0.02). Considering that nonobese people with hyperinsulinemia were at higher risk of cancer mortality than those without hyperinsulinemia, improvement of hyperinsulinemia may be an important approach for preventing cancer regardless of the presence or absence of obesity., 
What's new?
, Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes are associated with cancer‐related mortality, with hyperinsulinemia possibly playing a role. However, hyperinsulinemia also occurs in nonobese people. So far, no study has investigated whether hyperinsulinemia in nonobese people without diabetes is associated with increased risks of cancer‐related death. This prospective cohort study shows that among nonobese people, hyperinsulinemia was associated with a significantly higher risk of cancer mortality. Furthermore, hyperinsulinemia was associated with an increased risk of cancer death in people with normal fasting plasma glucose levels. Improvement of hyperinsulinemia may thus be an important approach for preventing cancer regardless of obesity.},

We have previously characterized a cell line of human breast cancer in long-term tissue culture that possesses various steroid hormone receptors and responses, providing a model for the study of steroid hormone action. The present studies describe a human breast cancer in vitro that responds to physiologie concentrations of insulin with an increased rate of macromolecular synthesis and growth. Thymidine and uridine incorporation in cells in serum-free medium are stimulated by 10(-11) M insulin and are maximal with 10(-8) M. Leucine incorporation is stimulated by 5 X 10(-11) M insulin and is maximal with 10(-9) M. Significant stimulation of uridine and leucine incorporation is evident by 3 hr and maximal by 10 hr. A 10-hr lag period exists for insulin stimulation of thymidine incorporation, which is maximal form 14 to 24 hr. The effect of 10(-8) M insulin on macromolecular synthesis is accompanied by a 69\% increase above controls in the number of cells after 24 hr. The effect on macromolecular synthesis is observed in glucose-free medium. Insulin's effect on protein synthesis is not blocked by inhibition of {RNA} synthesis with actinomycin D. Glucocorticoids partially inhibit the action of insulin in these cells. This system provides a model for studying insulin action, and suggests that some human breast cancer may show growth regulation by insulin.},

Epidemiologic studies have documented a link between elevated {IGF} levels and the development of solid tumors, such as breast, colon and prostate cancer. Anticancer strategies targeting the {IGF} signaling system involve two main approaches, namely neutralizing antibodies and small molecule inhibitors of the {IGF}-1R kinase activity. There are numerous reports describing anti-tumor activity of these agents in pre-clinical models of major human cancers. In addition, multiple clinical trials have started to evaluate the safety and efficacy of selected {IGF}-1R inhibitors, in combination with standard chemotherapeutic regimens or other targeted agents in cancer patients.

	abstract = {Mutations in {PIK}3CA, encoding the insulin-activated phosphoinositide-3-kinase ({PI}3K), and loss of function mutations in {PTEN}, a phosphatase that degrades the phosphoinositide lipids generated by {PI}3K, are among the most frequent events in human cancers,. Yet, pharmacological inhibition of {PI}3K has resulted in variable clinical responses, raising the possibility of an inherent mechanism of resistance. Since the {PIK}3CA-encoded enzyme, p110α, mediates virtually all cellular responses to insulin, targeted inhibition of this enzyme disrupts glucose metabolism in multiple tissue types. For example, blocking insulin signaling promotes glycogen breakdown in the liver and prevents glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, resulting in transient hyperglycemia that occurs within a few hours of {PI}3K inhibition. The effect is usually transient because compensatory insulin release from the pancreas (i.e. insulin feedback) restores normal glucose homeostasis. However, the hyperglycemia may be exacerbated or prolonged in patients with any degree of insulin resistance and, in these cases, requires discontinuation of therapy–. We hypothesized that insulin feedback induced by {PI}3K inhibitors may be reactivating the {PI}3K-{mTOR} signaling axis in tumors, compromising their effectiveness,. Here, we show in several model tumors, that systemic glucose-insulin feedback caused by targeted inhibition of this pathway is sufficient to activate {PI}3K signaling, even in the presence of {PI}3K inhibitors. We demonstrate that this insulin feedback can be prevented using dietary or pharmaceutical approaches, which greatly enhance the efficacy/toxicity ratios of these compounds. These findings have direct clinical implications for the multiple p110α inhibitors that are in clinical trials and provide a means to significantly increase treatment efficacy for patients with a myriad of tumor types.},

This phase Ib study evaluated alpelisib plus letrozole's safety, tolerability, and preliminary activity in patients with metastatic {ER}+ breast cancer refractory to endocrine therapy.
{EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: Twenty-six patients received letrozole and alpelisib daily. Outcomes were assessed by standard solid-tumor phase I methods. Tumor blocks were collected for {DNA} extraction and next-generation sequencing.
{RESULTS}: Alpelisib's maximum-tolerated dose ({MTD}) in combination with letrozole was 300 mg/d. Common drug-related adverse events included hyperglycemia, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, and rash with dose-limiting toxicity occurring at 350 mg/d of alpelisib. The clinical benefit rate (lack of progression ≥6 months) was 35\% (44\% in patients with {PIK}3CA-mutated and 20\% in {PIK}3CA wild-type tumors; 95\% {CI}, 17\%-56\%), including five objective responses. Of eight patients remaining on treatment ≥12 months, six had tumors with a {PIK}3CA mutation. Among evaluable tumors, those with {FGFR}1/2 amplification and {KRAS} and {TP}53 mutations did not derive clinical benefit. Overexpression of {FGFR}1 in {ER}+/{PIK}3CA mutant breast cancer cells attenuated the response to alpelisib in vitro {CONCLUSIONS}: The combination of letrozole and alpelisib was safe, with reversible toxicities.

Cancer cells are characterized by wholesale changes in long-range gene interactions, but the role that these long-range interactions play in cancer progression and metastasis is not well understood. In this study, we used {IGFBP}3, a gene involved in breast cancer pathogenesis, as bait in a 4C-seq experiment comparing normal breast cells ({HMEC}) with two breast cancer cell lines ({MCF}7, an {ER} positive cell line, and {MDA}-{MB}-231, a triple negative cell line). The {IGFBP}3 long-range interaction profile was substantially altered in breast cancer. Many interactions seen in normal breast cells are lost and novel interactions appear in cancer lines. We found that in {HMEC}, the breast carcinoma amplified sequence gene family ({BCAS}) 1–4 were among the top 10 most significantly enriched regions of interaction with {IGFBP}3. 3D-{FISH} analysis indicated that the translocation-prone {BCAS} genes, which are located on chromosomes 1, 17, and 20, are in close physical proximity with {IGFBP}3 and each other in normal breast cells. We also found that epidermal growth factor receptor ({EGFR}), a gene implicated in tumorigenesis, interacts significantly with {IGFBP}3 and that this interaction may play a role in their regulation. Breakpoint analysis suggests that when an {IGFBP}3 interacting region undergoes a translocation an additional interaction detectable by 4C is gained. Overall, our data from multiple lines of evidence suggest an important role for long-range chromosomal interactions in the pathogenesis of cancer.},

In agreement with previous in vitro studies, we find that the heat shock-mediated transcriptional induction of the hsp70 genes perturbs their chromatin structure, resulting in fewer protein-{DNA} contacts crosslinkable in vivo by formaldehyde. However, contrary to earlier in vitro evidence that histones may be absent from actively transcribed genes, we show directly, by immunoprecipitation of in vivo-crosslinked chromatin fragments, that at least histone H4 remains bound to hsp70 {DNA} in vivo, irrespective of its rate of transcription. The formaldehyde-based in vivo mapping techniques described in this work are generally applicable, and can be used both to probe protein-{DNA} interactions within specific genes and to determine the genomic location of specific chromosomal proteins.},

It was primarily acknowledged that {miRNAs} result in gene expression repression at both the level of {mRNA} stability by conducting {mRNA} degradation and the level of translation (at initiation and after initiation) by inhibiting protein translation or degrading the polypeptides through binding complementarily to 3′{UTR} of the target {mRNAs}. Nevertheless, some studies revealed that {miRNAs} have the capability of activating gene expression directly or indirectly in respond to different cell types and conditions and in the presence of distinct cofactors. This reversibility in their posttranslational gene regulatory natures enables the bearing cells to rapidly response to different cell conditions and consequently block unnecessary energy wastage or maintain the cell state. This paper provides an overview of the current understandings of the {miRNA} characteristics including their genes and biogenesis, as well as their mediated downregulation. We also review up-to-date knowledge of {miRNA}-mediated gene upregulation through highlighting some notable examples and discuss the emerging concepts of their associations with other posttranscriptional gene regulation processes.},

We discuss similarities between normal mammary epithelial developmental states and various breast cancer molecular sub-types, and the cells that are thought to propagate them. We emphasize that while stem cell phenotypes and mesenchymal character have often been conflated, existing data suggest that the combination of intrinsic genetic and epigenetic changes, and microenvironmental influences generate multiple types of tumor propagating cells distinguishable by their positions along a continuum of epithelial to mesenchymal, stem to differentiated and embryonic to mature cell states. Consequently, in addition to the prospect of stem cell-directed tumor therapies, there is a need to understand interrelationships between stem cell, epithelial-mesenchymal, and tumor-associated reprogramming events to develop new therapies that mitigate cell state plasticity and minimize the evolution of tumor heterogeneity.},

Two prevailing concepts, the stochastic theory and the hierarchical theory, are traditionally used to understand tumor progression. These seemingly contradictory theories can be reconciled with the concept of cellular plasticity, such that certain genetic mutations enable epigenetic alterations in cell fate. A growing body of evidence suggests that cancer cells co-opt embryonic stem cell-associated regulatory networks in order to sustain tumor cell plasticity concomitant with growth and progression. The expression of these stem cell associated factors is regulated by dynamic niches, characterized by cellderived proteins as well as biophysical features such low oxygen tensions. In this review we describe specific embryo-associated proteins such as {NODAL}, {NOTCH}, and canonical {WNT}, which cooperate to maintain stem cell phenotypes in cancer. We also illustrate how biophysical factors, in particular oxygen, can orchestrate plasticity by modulating the expression of stem cell-associated proteins. As the microenvironment is known to play a key role in cellular regulation, it is essential to understand its role in cancer progression in order to improve and create new therapies.},

Using this novel method, several studies have demonstrated the widespread role of short upstream reading frames in translational control as well as slower elongation at the beginning of open reading frames in response to stress. Based on the initial studies, the importance of adding or omitting translation inhibitors, such as cycloheximide, was noted as it markedly affected ribosome coverage profiles. For that reason, many recent studies omitted translation inhibitors in the culture medium. Here, we investigate the influence of ranging cycloheximide concentrations on ribosome profiles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and demonstrate that increasing the drug concentration can overcome some of the artifacts. We subjected cells to various manipulations and show that neither oxidative stress nor heat shock nor amino acid starvation affect translation elongation. Instead, the observations in the initial studies are the result of cycloheximide-inflicted artifacts. Likewise, we find little support for short upstream reading frames to be involved in widespread protein synthesis regulation under stress conditions. Our study highlights the need for better standardization of ribosome profiling methods.},

Recent genome-wide ribosome profiling studies suggest that thousands of {uORFs} initiate with non-{AUG} start codons. Although intriguing, these non-{AUG} {uORF} predictions have been made without statistical control or validation; thus, the importance of these elements remains to be demonstrated. To address this, we took a comparative genomics approach to study {AUG} and non-{AUG} {uORFs}. We mapped transcription leaders in multiple Saccharomyces yeast species and applied a novel machine learning algorithm ({uORF}-seqr) to ribosome profiling data to identify statistically significant {uORFs}. We found that {AUG} and non-{AUG} {uORFs} are both frequently found in Saccharomyces yeasts. Although most non-{AUG} {uORFs} are found in only one species, hundreds have either conserved sequence or position within Saccharomyces. {uORFs} initiating with {UUG} are particularly common and are shared between species at rates similar to that of {AUG} {uORFs}. However, non-{AUG} {uORFs} are translated less efficiently than {AUG}-{uORFs} and are less subject to removal via alternative transcription initiation under normal growth conditions. These results suggest that a subset of non-{AUG} {uORFs} may play important roles in regulating gene expression.},

Recent ribosome profiling studies in yeast, however, have reached contradictory conclusions regarding the average translation rate of each codon. Some experiments have used cycloheximide ({CHX}) to stabilize ribosomes before measuring their positions, and these studies all counterintuitively report a weak negative correlation between the translation rate of a codon and the abundance of its cognate {tRNA}. In contrast, some experiments performed without {CHX} report strong positive correlations. To explain this contradiction, we identify unexpected patterns in ribosome density downstream of each type of codon in experiments that use {CHX}. These patterns are evidence that elongation continues to occur in the presence of {CHX} but with dramatically altered codon-specific elongation rates. The measured positions of ribosomes in these experiments therefore do not reflect the amounts of time ribosomes spend at each position in vivo. These results suggest that conclusions from experiments in yeast using {CHX} may need reexamination. In particular, we show that in all such experiments, codons decoded by less abundant {tRNAs} were in fact being translated more slowly before the addition of {CHX} disrupted these dynamics.},

Nevertheless, numerous analyses of the first riboprofiling data set have produced equivocal and often incompatible results. Here we analyze three independent yeast riboprofiling data sets, including two with much higher coverage than previously available, and find that all three show substantial technical sequence biases that confound interpretations of ribosomal occupancy. After accounting for these biases, we find no effect of previously implicated factors on ribosomal pausing. Rather, we find that incorporation of proline, whose unique side-chain stalls peptide synthesis in vitro, also slows the ribosome in vivo. We also reanalyze a method that implicated positively charged amino acids as the major determinant of ribosomal stalling and demonstrate that it produces false signals of stalling in low-coverage data. Our results suggest that any analysis of riboprofiling data should account for sequencing biases and sparse coverage. To this end, we establish a robust methodology that enables analysis of ribosome profiling data without prior assumptions regarding which positions spanned by the ribosome cause stalling.},

Through loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and clinical-association studies, we implicate {tRNAGluUUC} and {tRNAArgCCG} as promoters of breast cancer metastasis. Upregulation of these {tRNAs} enhances stability and ribosome occupancy of transcripts enriched for their cognate codons. Specifically, {tRNAGluUUC} promotes metastatic progression by directly enhancing {EXOSC}2 expression and enhancing {GRIPAP}1—constituting an “inducible” pathway driven by a {tRNA}. The cellular proteomic shift toward a pro-metastatic state mirrors global {tRNA} shifts, allowing for cell-state and cell-type transgene expression optimization through codon content quantification. {TRNA} modulation represents a mechanism by which cells achieve altered expression of specific transcripts and proteins. {TRNAs} are thus dynamic regulators of gene expression and the {tRNA} codon landscape can causally and specifically impact disease progression.},

However, the relationship between human transcript diversity and protein production is complex as each isoform can be translated differently. We fractionated a polysome profile and reconstructed transcript isoforms from each fraction, which we term Transcript Isoforms in Polysomes sequencing ({TrIP}-seq). Analysis of these data revealed regulatory features that control ribosome occupancy and translational output of each transcript isoform. We extracted a panel of 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions that control protein production from an unrelated gene in cells over a 100-fold range. Select 5′ untranslated regions exert robust translational control between cell lines, while 3′ untranslated regions can confer cell type-specific expression. These results expose the large dynamic range of transcript-isoform-specific translational control, identify isoform-specific sequences that control protein output in human cells, and demonstrate that transcript isoform diversity must be considered when relating {RNA} and protein levels.},

Overexpression of {eIF}-4E in experimental models dramatically alters cellular morphology, enhances proliferation and induces cellular transformation, tumorigenesis and metastasis. Conversely, blocking {eIF}-4E function by expression of antisense {RNA}, or overexpression of the inhibitory {eIF}-4E binding proteins (4E-{BPs}), suppresses cellular transformation, tumor growth, tumor invasiveness and metastasis. Although {eIF}-4E regulates the recruitment of {mRNA} to ribosomes, and thereby globally regulates cap-dependent protein synthesis, {eIF}-4E contributes to malignancy by selectively enabling the translation of a limited pool of {mRNAs}--those that generally encode key proteins involved in cellular growth, angiogenesis, survival and malignancy (e.g. cyclin D1, c-myc, vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloprotease 9). A deeper understanding of the role of {eIF}-4E in regulating the translation of the diverse gene products involved in all aspects of malignancy will improve the capacity to exploit {eIF}-4E as a therapeutic target and as a marker for human cancer progression.},

	abstract = {The proto-oncogene Fli-1 encodes a transcription factor of the ets family whose overexpression is associated with multiple virally induced leukemias in mouse, inhibits murine and avian erythroid cell differentiation, and induces drastic perturbations of early development in Xenopus. This study demonstrates the surprisingly sophisticated regulation of Fli-1 {mRNA} translation. We establish that two {FLI}-1 protein isoforms (of 51 and 48 {kDa}) detected by Western blotting in vivo are synthesized by alternative translation initiation through the use of two highly conserved in-frame initiation codons, {AUG} +1 and {AUG} +100. Furthermore, we show that the synthesis of these two {FLI}-1 isoforms is regulated by two short overlapping 5' upstream open reading frames ({uORF}) beginning at two highly conserved upstream initiation codons, {AUG} -41 and {GUG} -37, and terminating at two highly conserved stop codons, {UGA} +35 and {UAA} +15. The mutational analysis of these two 5' {uORF} revealed that each of them negatively regulates {FLI}-1 protein synthesis by precluding cap-dependent scanning to the 48- and 51-{kDa} {AUG} codons. Simultaneously, the translation termination of the two 5' {uORF} appears to enhance 48-{kDa} protein synthesis, by allowing downstream reinitiation at the 48-{kDa} {AUG} codon, and 51-{kDa} protein synthesis, by allowing scanning ribosomes to pile up and consequently allowing upstream initiation at the 51-{kDa} {AUG} codon. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a cellular {mRNA} displaying overlapping 5' {uORF} whose translation termination appears to be involved in the positive control of translation initiation at both downstream and upstream initiation codons.},

	abstract = {A small upstream open reading frame ({uORF}), located 14 nucleotides from the cap in the 5' transcript leader (5' {TL}) of the {mRNA} encoding S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase ({AdoMetDC}), suppresses translation of the downstream cistron in normal T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined the structural features of the 5' {TL} that overcome this suppressive influence in cells of nonlymphoid origin. Initiation at the downstream cistron in nonlymphoid cells is by a cap-dependent mechanism that requires ribosome scanning along the 5' {TL} and does not involve an internal ribosome entry site. Extending the {uORF} so that it overlapped the major cistron by 101 nucleotides had no effect on translation of the downstream cistron in either {HeLa} or Jurkat cells. When the distance between the {uORF} and the cap was extended to 47 nucleotides, using sequence previously found to be neutral, translation of the major cistron was inhibited 5-fold in {HeLa} cells and the {mRNA} was moved from polysomes to monosomes, a location identical to that of the wild type {mRNA} in Jurkat cells. Therefore, in contrast to T cells, initiation at the {uORF} seems to be relatively infrequent in non-lymphoid cells due to its proximity to the cap, allowing efficient translation of the downstream cistron.},

	abstract = {The kinase {PKR} is a central component of the interferon antiviral pathway. {PKR} is activated upon binding double-stranded (ds) {RNA} to undergo autophosphorylation. Although {PKR} is known to dimerize, the relationship between dimerization and activation remains unclear. Here, we directly characterize dimerization of {PKR} in free solution using analytical ultracentrifugation and correlate self-association with autophosphorylation activity. Latent, unphosphorylated {PKR} exists predominantly as a monomer at protein concentrations below 2 mg/ml. A monomer sedimentation coefficient of s(20,w)(0)=3.58 S and a frictional ratio of f/f(0)=1.62 indicate an asymmetric shape. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements indicate that {PKR} undergoes a weak, reversible monomer-dimer equilibrium with K(d)=450 {microM}. This dimerization reaction serves to initiate a previously unrecognized {dsRNA}-independent autophosphorylation reaction. The resulting activated enzyme is phosphorylated on the two critical threonine residues present in the activation loop and is competent to phosphorylate the physiological substrate, {eIF}2alpha. Dimer stability is enhanced by approximately 500-fold upon autophosphorylation. We propose a chain reaction model for {PKR} {dsRNA}-independent activation where dimerization of latent enzyme followed by intermolecular phosphorylation serves as the initiation step. Subsequent propagation steps likely involve phosphorylation of latent {PKR} monomers by activated enzyme within high-affinity heterodimers. Our results support a model whereby {dsRNA} functions by bringing {PKR} monomers into close proximity in a manner that is analogous to the dimerization of free {PKR}.},

Enhanced {eIF}4E function results from {eIF}4E overexpression and/or activation of the ras and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/{AKT} pathways and selectively increases the translation of key {mRNAs} involved in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and cell survival. Consequently, by simultaneously and selectively reducing the expression of numerous potent growth and survival factors critical for malignancy, targeting {eIF}4E for inhibition may provide an attractive therapy for many different tumor types. Recent work has now shown the plausibility of therapeutically targeting {eIF}4E and has resulted in the advance of the first {eIF}4E-specific therapy to clinical trials. These studies illustrate the increased susceptibility of tumor tissues to {eIF}4E inhibition and support the notion that the enhanced {eIF}4E function common to many tumor types may represent an Achilles' heel for cancer.

	abstract = {Caspase-2 represents the most conserved member of the caspase family, which exhibits features of both initiator and effector caspases. Using ribonucleoprotein ({RNP})-immunoprecipitation assay, we identified the proapoptotic caspase-2L encoding {mRNA} as a novel target of the ubiquitous {RNA}-binding protein {HuR} in {DLD}-1 colon carcinoma cells. Unexpectedly, crosslinking-{RNP} and {RNA} probe pull-down experiments revealed that {HuR} binds exclusively to the caspase-2-5′ untranslated region ({UTR}) despite that the 3′ {UTR} of the {mRNA} bears several adenylate- and uridylate-rich elements representing the prototypical {HuR} binding sites. By using {RNAi}-mediated loss-of-function approach, we observed that {HuR} regulates the {mRNA} and in turn the protein levels of caspase-2 in a negative manner. Silencing of {HuR} did not affect the stability of caspase-2 {mRNA} but resulted in an increased redistribution of caspase-2 transcripts from {RNP} particles to translational active polysomes implicating that {HuR} exerts a direct repressive effect on caspase-2 translation. Consistently, in vitro translation of a luciferase reporter gene under the control of an upstream caspase-2-5′{UTR} was strongly impaired after the addition of recombinant {HuR}, whereas translation of caspase-2 coding region without the 5′{UTR} is not affected by {HuR} confirming the functional role of the caspase-2-5′{UTR}. Functionally, an elevation in caspase-2 level by {HuR} knockdown correlated with an increased sensitivity of cells to apoptosis induced by staurosporine- and pore-forming toxins as implicated by their significant accumulation in the sub G1 phase and an increase in caspase-2, -3 and poly {ADP}-ribose polymerase cleavage, respectively. Importantly, {HuR} knockdown cells remained insensitive toward {STS}-induced apoptosis if cells were additionally transfected with caspase-2-specific {siRNAs}. Collectively, our findings support the hypothesis that {HuR} by acting as an endogenous inhibitor of caspase-2-driven apoptosis may essentially contribute to the antiapoptotic program of adenocarcinoma cells by {HuR}.},

	abstract = {La was first identified as a polypeptide component of ribonucleic protein complexes targeted by antibodies in autoimmune patients and is now known to be a eukaryote cell-ubiquitous protein. Structure and function studies have shown that La binds to a common terminal motif, {UUU}-3'-{OH}, of nascent {RNA} polymerase {III} ({RNAP} {III}) transcripts and protects them from exonucleolytic decay. For precursor-{tRNAs}, the most diverse and abundant of these transcripts, La also functions as an {RNA} chaperone that helps to prevent their misfolding. Related to this, we review evidence that suggests that La and its link to {RNAP} {III} were significant in the great expansions of the {tRNAomes} that occurred in eukaryotes. Four families of La-related proteins ({LARPs}) emerged during eukaryotic evolution with specialized functions. We provide an overview of the high-resolution structural biology of La and {LARPs}. {LARP}7 family members most closely resemble La but function with a single {RNAP} {III} nuclear transcript, 7SK, or telomerase {RNA}. A cytoplasmic isoform of La protein as well as {LARPs} 6, 4, and 1 function in {mRNA} metabolism and translation in distinct but similar ways, sometimes with the poly(A)-binding protein, and in some cases by direct binding to poly(A)-{RNA}. New structures of {LARP} domains, some complexed with {RNA}, provide novel insights into the functional versatility of these proteins. We also consider {LARPs} in relation to ancestral La protein and potential retention of links to specific {RNA}-related pathways.

The {RBP} {LARP}1 is an {mRNA} stability regulator, and elevated expression of the protein in hepatocellular and lung cancers is correlated with adverse prognosis. {LARP}1 associates with an {mRNA} interactome that is enriched for oncogenic transcripts. Here we explore the role of {LARP}1 in epithelial ovarian cancer, a disease characterized by the rapid acquisition of resistance to chemotherapy through the induction of pro-survival signalling. We show, using ovarian cell lines and xenografts, that {LARP}1 is required for cancer cell survival and chemotherapy resistance. {LARP}1 promotes tumour formation in vivo and maintains cancer stem cell-like populations. Using transcriptomic analysis following {LARP}1 knockdown, cross-referenced against the {LARP}1 interactome, we identify {BCL}2 and {BIK} as {LARP}1 {mRNA} targets. We demonstrate that, through an interaction with the 3' untranslated regions (3' {UTRs}) of {BCL}2 and {BIK}, {LARP}1 stabilizes {BCL}2 but destabilizes {BIK} with the net effect of resisting apoptosis. Together, our data indicate that by differentially regulating the stability of a selection of {mRNAs}, {LARP}1 promotes ovarian cancer progression and chemotherapy resistance.},

	abstract = {Increased activity of the {mRNA} helicase {eIF}4A drives cellular malignancy by reprogramming cellular translation, and {eIF}4A activity is the direct or indirect target of many emerging cancer therapeutics. The enriched presence of ({GGC})4 motifs, which have the potential to fold into two-layered G-quadruplexes, within the 5′{UTRs} of {eIF}4A-dependent {mRNAs} suggests that {eIF}4A is required for the unwinding of these structures within these {eIF}4A-controlled {mRNAs}. However, the existence of folded G-quadruplexes within cells remains controversial, and G-quadruplex folding is in direct competition with classical Watson–Crick based secondary structures. Using a combination of reverse transcription stalling assays and 7-deazaguanine incorporation experiments we find that ({GGC})4 motifs preferentially form classical secondary structures rather than G-quadruplexes in full-length {mRNAs}. Furthermore, using translation assays with the {eIF}4A inhibitor hippuristanol, both in vitro and in cells, we find that {eIF}4A activity alleviates translational repression of {mRNAs} with 5′{UTR} classical secondary structures significantly more than those with folded G-quadruplexes. This was particularly evident in experiments using a G-quadruplex stabilizing ligand, where shifting the structural equilibrium in favour of G-quadruplex formation diminishes {eIF}4A-dependency. This suggests that enrichment of ({GGC})4 motifs in the 5′{UTRs} of {eIF}4A-dependent {mRNAs} is due to the formation of stable hairpin structures rather than G-quadruplexes.},

Given the relevance of translational control in determining cell phenotypes, we evaluated the translatome, i.e., the transcriptome engaged in translation, as a descriptor of the effects of genetic instability in cancer. We performed this evaluation in high-risk neuroblastomas, which are characterized by a low frequency of point mutations or known cancer-driving genes and by the presence of several segmental chromosomal aberrations that produce gene-copy imbalances that guide aggressiveness. We thus integrated genome, transcriptome, translatome and {miRome} profiles in a representative panel of high-risk neuroblastoma cell lines. We identified a number of genes whose genomic imbalance was corrected by compensatory adaptations in translational efficiency. The transcriptomic level of these genes was predictive of poor prognosis in more than half of cases and the genomic imbalances found in their loci were shared by 27 other tumor types. This homeostatic process is also not limited to copy number-altered genes, as we showed the translational stoichiometric rebalance of histone genes. We suggest that the translational buffering of fluctuations in these dose-sensitive transcripts is a potential driving process of neuroblastoma evolution.},

Our results show that hypoxia through hypoxia-inducible factor ({HIF}) brings about a time-dependent increase in the level of an oncogenic {microRNA}, {miR}-191 in various breast cancer cell lines. {miR}-191 enhances breast cancer aggressiveness by promoting cell proliferation, migration and survival under hypoxia. We further established that {miR}-191 is a critical regulator of transforming growth factor beta ({TGFβ})-signaling and promotes cell migration by inducing {TGFβ}2 expression under hypoxia through direct binding and indirectly by regulating levels of a {RNA} binding protein, human antigen R ({HuR}). The levels of several {TGFβ} pathway genes (like {VEGFA}, {SMAD}3, {CTGF} and {BMP}4) were found to be higher in {miR}-191 overexpressing cells. Lastly, anti-{miR}-191 treatment given to breast tumor spheroids led to drastic reduction in spheroid tumor volume. This stands as a first report of identification of a {microRNA} mediator that links hypoxia and the {TGFβ} signaling pathways, both of which are involved in regulation of breast cancer metastasis. Together, our results show a critical role of {miR}-191 in hypoxia-induced cancer progression and suggest that {miR}-191 inhibition may offer a novel therapy for hypoxic breast tumors.},

In this study, we have analyzed the level of {miR}-10b and cell motility and invasiveness in several human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. Our results reveal a significant correlation of {miR}-10b level with cell motility and invasiveness. Overexpression of {miR}-10b in {KYSE}140 cells increased cell motility and invasiveness, whereas inhibition of {miR}-10b in {EC}9706 cells reduced cell invasiveness, although it did not alter cell motility. Additionally, we identified {KLF}4, a known tumor suppressor gene that has been reported to suppress esophageal cancer cell migration and invasion, as a direct target of {miR}-10b. Furthermore, overexpression of {miR}-10b in {KYSE}140 and {KYSE}450 cells led to a reduction of endogenous {KLF}4 protein, whereas silencing of {miR}-10b in {EC}9706 cells caused up-regulation of {KLF}4 protein. Coexpression of {miR}-10b and {KLF}4 in {KYSE}140 cells and coexpression of small interfering {RNA} for {KLF}4 {mRNA} and {miR}-10b-{AS} in {EC}9706 cells partially abrogated the effect of {miR}-10b on cell migration and invasion. Finally, analyses of the {miR}-10b level in 40 human esophageal cancer samples and their paired normal adjacent tissues revealed an elevated expression of {miR}-10b in 95\% (38 of 40) of cancer tissues, although no significant correlation of the {miR}-10b level with clinical metastasis status was observed in these samples.},

Using 10058-F4, a compound that inhibits {MYC}-{MAX} transcription factor, {MYC} protein and gene expression were down-regulated in Namalwa cells, a Burkitt lymphoma. Compound 10058-F4 decreased {MYC} {mRNA} (45\%), {MYC} protein (50\%), and cell growth (32\%). {MYC}-{MAX} transcription factor was disrupted 24 h after treatment, resulting in transcriptional inhibition of target genes. Because {microRNAs} ({miRNA}) disrupt {mRNA} translation, let-7a, let-7b, and mir-98 were selected using bioinformatics for targeting {MYC}. Inhibition of {MYC}-{MAX} transcription factor with 10058-F4 increased levels of members of the let-7 family. In inhibited cells at 24 h, let-7a, let-7b, and mir-98 were induced 4.9-, 1.3-, and 2.4-fold, respectively, whereas mir-17-5p decreased 0.23-fold. These results were duplicated using {microRNA} multianalyte suspension array technology. Regulation of {MYC} {mRNA} by let-7a was confirmed by transfections with pre-let-7a. Overexpression of let-7a (190\%) decreased Myc {mRNA} (70\%) and protein (75\%). Down-regulation of Myc protein and {mRNA} using {siRNA} {MYC} also elevated let-7a {miRNA} and decreased Myc gene expression. Inverse coordinate regulation of let-7a and mir-17-5p versus Myc {mRNA} by 10058-F4, pre-let-7a, or {siRNA} {MYC} suggested that both {miRNAs} are Myc-regulated. This supports previous results in lung and colon cancer where decreased levels of the let-7 family resulted in increased tumorigenicity. Here, pre-let-7a transfections led to down-regulation of expression of {MYC} and its target genes and antiproliferation in lymphoma cells. These findings with let-7a add to the complexity of {MYC} regulation and suggest that dysregulation of these {miRNAs} participates in the genesis and maintenance of the lymphoma phenotype in Burkitt lymphoma cells and other {MYC}-dysregulated cancers.},

	abstract = {In this study we have identified a functional role for {miR}-29a in cancer cell invasion and proliferation. {MiRNA} expression profiling of human {NSCLC} cell lines indicated that {miR}-29a levels were reduced in more invasive cell lines. Exogenous overexpression of {miR}-29a in both lung and pancreatic cancer cell lines resulted in a significant reduction in the invasion phenotype, as well as in proliferation. 2D {DIGE} proteomic profiling of cells transfected with pre-{miR}-29a or anti-{miR}-29a resulted in the identification of over 100 differentially regulated proteins. The fold change of protein expression was generally modest--in the range 1.2-1.7-fold. Only 14 were predicted computationally to have {miR}-29a seed sequences in their 3' {UTR} region. Subsequent studies using {siRNA} to knock down several candidate proteins from the 2D {DIGE} experiment identified {RAN} (a member of the {RAS} oncogene family) which significantly reduced the invasive capability of a model lung cancer cell line. We conclude that {miR}-29a has a significant anti-invasive and anti-proliferative effect on lung cancer cells in vitro and functions as an anti-oncomir. This function is likely mediated through the post-transcriptional fine tuning of the cellular levels of several proteins, both directly and indirectly, and in particular we provide some evidence that {RAN} represents one of these.},

	abstract = {{MicroRNAs} ({miRNAs}) are pervasively expressed and regulate most biological functions. They function by modulating transcriptional and translational programs and therefore they orchestrate both physiological and pathological processes, such as development, cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and tumor growth. {miRNAs} work as small guide molecules in {RNA} silencing, by negatively regulating the expression of several genes both at {mRNA} and protein level, by degrading their {mRNA} target and/or by silencing translation. One of the most recent advances in the field is the comprehension of their role in oncogenesis. The number of {miRNA} genes is increasing and an alteration in the level of {miRNAs} is involved in the initiation, progression and metastases formation of several tumors. Some tumor types show a distinct {miRNA} signature that distinguishes them from normal tissues and from other cancer types. Genetic and biochemical evidence supports the essential role of {miRNAs} in tumor development. Although the abnormal expression of {miRNAs} in cancer cells is a widely accepted phenomenon, the cause of this dysregulation is still unknown. Here, we discuss the biogenesis of {miRNAs}, focusing on the mechanisms by which they regulate protein synthesis. In addition we debate on their role in cancer, highlighting their potential to become therapeutic targets.},

	abstract = {{PKR} (protein kinase R) is a central component of the interferon antiviral defense pathway. Upon binding {dsRNA}, {PKR} undergoes autophosphorylation reactions that activate the kinase. {PKR} then phosphorylates {eIF}2α, thus inhibiting protein synthesis in virally-infected cells. Here, we define the mechanism of {PKR} activation using a series {dsRNAs} of increasing length. A minimal {dsRNA} of 30 bp is required to bind two {PKR} monomers and 30 bp is the smallest {dsRNA} that elicits autophosphorylation activity. Thus, the ability of {dsRNAs} to function as {PKR} activators is correlated with binding of two or more {PKR} monomers. Sedimentation velocity data fit a model where {PKR} monomers sequentially attach to a single {dsRNA}. These results support an activation mechanism where the role of the {dsRNA} is to bring two or more {PKR} monomers in close proximity to enhance dimerization via the kinase domain. This model explains the inhibition observed at high {dsRNA} concentrations and the strong dependence of maximum activation on {dsRNA} binding affinity. Binding affinities increase dramatically upon reducing the salt concentration from 200 to 75 {mM} {NaCl} and we observe that a second {PKR} can bind to the 20 bp {dsRNA}. Nonspecific assembly of {PKR} on {dsRNA} occurs stochastically without apparent cooperativity.},

Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease.},

Herein we tested the possible involvement of the 3′-{UTR} in the localization of an {mRNA} that encodes a very short Saccharomyces cerevisiae protein (Pmp1). We found by ribosome density mapping, sedimentation analysis, differential centrifugation, and fluorescent in situ hybridization that the 3′-{UTR} is essential for the association of the transcript with membrane compartments. Fusion of the 3′-{UTR} to heterologous open reading frames conferred on them a sedimentation and cellular localization pattern resembling that of {PMP}1. Mutation analysis revealed that a repeating {UG}-rich sequence within the 3′-{UTR} is important for membrane association. Taken together, our results reveal an essential role for elements within the 3′-{UTR} in the localization of an {mRNA} that is likely to be ignored by the standard signal-dependant mechanism.},

	abstract = {The scanning model for eukaryotic {mRNA} translation initiation states that the small ribosomal subunit, along with initiation factors, binds at the cap structure at the 5' end of the {mRNA} and scans the 5' untranslated region (5'{UTR}) until an initiation codon is found. However, under conditions that impair canonical cap-dependent translation, the synthesis of some proteins is kept by alternative mechanisms that are required for cell survival and stress recovery. Alternative modes of translation initiation include cap- and/or scanning-independent mechanisms of ribosomal recruitment. In most cap-independent translation initiation events there is a direct recruitment of the 40S ribosome into a position upstream, or directly at, the initiation codon via a specific internal ribosome entry site ({IRES}) element in the 5'{UTR}. Yet, in some cellular {mRNAs}, a different translation initiation mechanism that is neither cap- nor {IRES}-dependent seems to occur through a special {RNA} structure called cap-independent translational enhancer ({CITE}). Recent evidence uncovered a distinct mechanism through which {mRNAs} containing N 6-methyladenosine (m6A) residues in their 5'{UTR} directly bind eukaryotic initiation factor 3 ({eIF}3) and the 40S ribosomal subunit in order to initiate translation in the absence of the cap-binding proteins. This review focuses on the important role of cap-independent translation mechanisms in human cells and how these alternative mechanisms can either act individually or cooperate with other cis-acting {RNA} regulons to orchestrate specific translational responses triggered upon several cellular stress states, and diseases such as cancer. Elucidation of these non-canonical mechanisms reveals the complexity of translational control and points out their potential as prospective novel therapeutic targets.},

	abstract = {The study of hereditary tumor syndromes has laid a solid foundation toward understanding the genetic basis of cancer. One of the latest examples comes from the study of tuberous sclerosis complex ({TSC}). As a member of the phakomatoses, {TSC} is characterized by the appearance of benign tumors, most notably in the central nervous system, kidney, heart, lung, and skin. While classically described as “hamartomas,” the pathology of the lesions has features suggestive of abnormal cellular proliferation, size, differentiation, and migration. Occasionally, tumors progress to become malignant (i.e., renal cell carcinoma). The genetic basis of this disease has been attributed to mutations in one of two unlinked genes, {TSC}1 and {TSC}2. Cells undergo bi-allelic inactivation of either gene to give rise to tumors in a classic tumor suppressor “two-hit” paradigm. The functions of the {TSC}1 and {TSC}2 gene products, hamartin and tuberin, respectively, have remained ill defined until recently. Genetic, biochemical, and biologic analyses have highlighted their role as negative regulators of the {mTOR} signaling pathway. Tuberin, serving as a substrate of {AKT} and {AMPK}, mediates {mTOR} activity by coordinating inputs from growth factors and energy availability in the control of cell growth, proliferation, and survival. Emerging evidence also suggests that the {TSC}1/2 complex may play a role in modulating the activity of β–catenin and {TGFβ}. These findings provide novel functional links between the {TSC} genes and other tumor suppressors responsible for Cowden′s disease ({PTEN}), Peutz-Jeghers syndrome ({LKB}1), and familial polyposis ({APC}). Common sporadic cancers such as prostate, lung, colon, endometrium, and breast have ties to these genes, highlighting the potential role of the {TSC} proteins in human cancers. Rapamycin, a specific {mTOR} inhibitor, has potent antitumoral activities in preclinical models of {TSC} and is currently undergoing phase I/{II} clinical studies.},

	abstract = {Mammalian target of rapamycin ({mTOR}) is a central regulator of protein synthesis whose activity is modulated by a variety of signals. Energy depletion and hypoxia result in {mTOR} inhibition. While energy depletion inhibits {mTOR} through a process involving the activation of {AMP}-activated protein kinase ({AMPK}) by {LKB}1 and subsequent phosphorylation of {TSC}2, the mechanism of {mTOR} inhibition by hypoxia is not known. Here we show that {mTOR} inhibition by hypoxia requires the {TSC}1/{TSC}2 tumor suppressor complex and the hypoxia-inducible gene {REDD}1/{RTP}801. Disruption of the {TSC}1/{TSC}2 complex through loss of {TSC}1 or {TSC}2 blocks the effects of hypoxia on {mTOR}, as measured by changes in the {mTOR} targets S6K and 4E-{BP}1, and results in abnormal accumulation of Hypoxia-inducible factor ({HIF}). In contrast to energy depletion, {mTOR} inhibition by hypoxia does not require {AMPK} or {LKB}1. Down-regulation of {mTOR} activity by hypoxia requires de novo {mRNA} synthesis and correlates with increased expression of the hypoxia-inducible {REDD}1 gene. Disruption of {REDD}1 abrogates the hypoxia-induced inhibition of {mTOR}, and {REDD}1 overexpression is sufficient to down-regulate S6K phosphorylation in a {TSC}1/{TSC}2-dependent manner. Inhibition of {mTOR} function by hypoxia is likely to be important for tumor suppression as {TSC}2-deficient cells maintain abnormally high levels of cell proliferation under hypoxia.},

Rheb, a Ras-related small {GTPase}, is a key upstream activator of {mTOR}. In this study, we found that Bnip3, a hypoxia-inducible Bcl-2 homology 3 domain-containing protein, directly binds Rheb and inhibits the {mTOR} pathway. Bnip3 decreases Rheb {GTP} levels in a manner depending on the binding to Rheb and the presence of the N-terminal domain. Both knockdown and overexpression experiments show that Bnip3 plays an important role in {mTOR} inactivation in response to hypoxia.

	abstract = {The {AMP}-activated serine/threonine protein kinase ({AMPK}) is a sensor of cellular energy status found in all eukaryotes that is activated under conditions of low intracellular {ATP} following stresses such as nutrient deprivation or hypoxia. In the past 5 years, work from a large number of laboratories has revealed that one of the major downstream signalling pathways regulated by {AMPK} is the mammalian target-of-rapamycin [mammalian target of rapamycin ({mTOR}) pathway]. Interestingly, like {AMPK}, the {mTOR} serine/threonine kinase plays key roles not only in growth control and cell proliferation but also in metabolism. Recent work has revealed that across eukaryotes {mTOR} orthologues are found in two biochemically distinct complexes and only one of those complexes ({mTORC}1 in mammals) is acutely sensitive to rapamycin and regulated by nutrients and {AMPK}. Many details of the molecular mechanism by which {AMPK} inhibits {mTORC}1 signalling have also been decoded in the past 5 years. {AMPK} directly phosphorylates at least two proteins to induce rapid suppression of {mTORC}1 activity, the {TSC}2 tumour suppressor and the critical {mTORC}1 binding subunit raptor. Here we explore the molecular connections between {AMPK} and {mTOR} signalling pathways and examine the physiological processes in which {AMPK} regulation of {mTOR} is critical for growth or metabolic control. The functional conservation of {AMPK} and {TOR} in all eukaryotes, and the sequence conservation around the {AMPK} phosphorylation sites in raptor across all eukaryotes examined suggest that this represents a fundamental cell growth module connecting nutrient status to the cell growth machinery. These findings have broad implications for the control of cell growth by nutrients in a number of cellular and organismal contexts.},

To directly address this issue, we have established viable and fertile knock-in mice, whose {rpS}6 contains alanine substitutions at all five phosphorylatable serine residues ({rpS}6P-/-). Here we show that contrary to the widely accepted model, this mutation does not affect the translational control of {TOP} {mRNAs}. {rpS}6P-/- mouse embryo fibroblasts ({MEFs}) display an increased rate of protein synthesis and accelerated cell division, and they are significantly smaller than {rpS}6P+/+ {MEFs}. This small size reflects a growth defect, rather than a by-product of their faster cell division. Moreover, the size of {rpS}6P-/- {MEFs}, unlike wild-type {MEFs}, is not further decreased upon rapamycin treatment, implying that the {rpS}6 is a critical downstream effector of {mTOR} in regulation of cell size. The small cell phenotype is not confined to embryonal cells, as it also selectively characterizes pancreatic β-cells in adult {rpS}6P-/- mice. These mice suffer from diminished levels of pancreatic insulin, hypoinsulinemia, and impaired glucose tolerance.},

Evidence has accumulated in support of a model in which these initiation factors function to unwind the 5'-proximal secondary structure in {mRNA} to facilitate ribosome binding. To obtain direct evidence for initiation factor-mediated {RNA} unwinding, we developed a simple assay to determine {RNA} helicase activity, and we show that {eIF}-4A or {eIF}-4F, in combination with {eIF}-4B, exhibits helicase activity. A striking and unprecedented feature of this activity is that it functions in a bidirectional manner. Thus, unwinding can occur either in the 5'-to-3' or 3'-to-5' direction. Unwinding in the 5'-to-3' direction by {eIF}-4F (the cap-binding protein complex), in conjunction with {eIF}-4B, was stimulated by the presence of the {RNA} 5' cap structure, whereas unwinding in the 3'-to-5' direction was completely cap independent. These results are discussed with respect to cap-dependent versus cap-independent mechanisms of ribosome binding to eucaryotic {mRNAs}.},

This study demonstrates how the helicase activity of {eIF}4A is modulated by {eIF}4B, {eIF}4H, or as a subunit of {eIF}4F. Results indicate that a linear relationship exists between the initial rate or amplitude of unwinding and duplex stability for all factor combinations tested. {eIF}4F, like {eIF}4A, behaves as a non-processive helicase. Either {eIF}4B or {eIF}4H stimulated the initial rate and amplitude of {eIF}4A-dependent duplex unwinding, and the magnitude of stimulation is dependent on duplex stability. Furthermore, {eIF}4A (or {eIF}4F) becomes a slightly processive helicase in the presence of {eIF}4B or {eIF}4H. All combinations of factors tested indicate that the rate of duplex unwinding is equivalent in the 5′ → 3′ and 3′ → 5′ directions. However, the optimal rate of unwinding was dependent on the length of the single-stranded region of the substrate when different combinations of factors were used. The combinations of {eIF}4A, {eIF}4A + {eIF}4B, {eIF}4A + {eIF}4H, and {eIF}4F showed differences in their ability to unwind chemically modified duplexes.

The shortening is controlled by {CPEB} and {PARN}, a poly(A)-specific ribonuclease. Gld2 and {PARN} both reside in the {CPEB}-containing complex. However, because {PARN} is more active than Gld2, the poly(A) tail is short.

In the mammalian nervous system, Ngd is detected as puncta in axons and dendrites and in growth cones and filopodia. Ngd contains three motifs that resemble those present in {eIF}4G, 4EBP, Cup, and Maskin, all of which are {eIF}4E binding proteins. Ngd binds {eIF}4E directly, and all three motifs must be deleted to abrogate the interaction between these two proteins. In injected Xenopus oocytes, Ngd binds {CPEB} and, most importantly, represses translation in a cytoplasmic polyadenylation element ({CPE})-dependent manner. In Xenopus embryos, Ngd is found in both neural tube and neural crest cells. The injection of morpholino-containing antisense oligonucleotides directed against ngd {mRNA} disrupts neural tube closure and neural crest migration; however, the wild-type phenotype is restored by the injection of a rescuing ngd {mRNA}.

Few studies have investigated how the level, and thus activity, of {eIF}4E is regulated in healthy (noncancerous) cells and how they become elevated in malignant cells. Here, our studies reveal a novel mechanism by which {eIF}4E levels are regulated at the level of {mRNA} stability. Two factors known to modulate transcript stability, {HuR} and the p42 isoform of {AUF}1, compete for binding to the 3' untranslated regions (3'{UTRs}) of {eIF}4E {mRNAs}. We identified a distinct {AU}-rich element in the 3'{UTR} of {eIF}4E which is responsible for {HuR}-mediated binding and stabilization. Our studies show that {HuR} is upregulated in malignant cancer specimens characterized by high {eIF}4E levels and that its depletion leads to reduction in {eIF}4E levels. Further, {HuR} and {eIF}4E regulate a common set of transcripts involved in cellular proliferation (cyclin D1 and c-myc) and neoangiogenesis (vascular endothelial growth factor), which suggests a functional connection between {HuR} and {eIF}4E in the regulation of these important processes.

Here we show that cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein 4 ({CPEB}4), an {RNA} binding protein that mediates meiotic {mRNA} cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translation, is overexpressed in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas and glioblastomas, where it supports tumor growth, vascularization and invasion. We also show that, in pancreatic tumors, the pro-oncogenic functions of {CPEB}4 originate in the translational activation of {mRNAs} that are silenced in normal tissue, including the {mRNA} of tissue plasminogen activator, a key contributor to pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma malignancy. Taken together, our results document a key role for post-transcriptional gene regulation in tumor development and describe a detailed mechanism for gene expression reprogramming underlying malignant tumor progression.},

Tumoral transformation is associated with profound effects in translational reprogramming of gene expression, such that tumour-specific translational regulation presents an attractive possibility for generating oncoselective therapies. We recently discovered that {mRNA} translational control by cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding proteins ({CPEBs}) is reactivated in cancer. Here we present a novel approach to restrict genetic-engineered therapies to malignant tissues based on {CPEB} translational regulation of target {mRNAs}. We demonstrate that tumour reprogramming of {CPEB}-mediated {mRNA} stability and translational regulation modulates tumour-specific expression of viral proteins. For oncolytic adenoviruses, insertion of {CPE} regulatory sequences in the 3′-untranslated region of the E1A gene provides oncoselectivity, with full potency in cancer cells but attenuated in normal tissues. Our results demonstrate the potential of this strategy to improve oncolytic virus design and provide a framework for exploiting {CPE}-regulated transgenes for therapy.},

	abstract = {Cellular stress such as endoplasmic reticulum stress, hypoxia, and viral
 infection activates an integrated stress response, which includes the
 phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor 2α ({eIF}2α) to
 inhibit overall protein synthesis. Paradoxically, this leads to translation of
 a subset of {mRNAs}, like transcription factor {ATF}4, which in turn induces
 transcription of downstream stress-induced genes such as growth arrest
 {DNA}-inducible gene 34 ({GADD}34). {GADD}34 interacts with protein phosphatase 1 to
 dephosphorylate {eIF}2α, resulting in a negative feedback loop to recover
 protein synthesis and allow translation of stress-induced transcripts. Here,
 we show that {GADD}34 is not only transcriptionally induced but also
 translationally regulated to ensure maximal expression during {eIF}2α
 phosphorylation. {GADD}34 {mRNAs} are preferentially associated with
 polysomes during {eIF}2α phosphorylation, which is mediated by its
 5′-untranslated region (5′{UTR}). The human {GADD}34
 5′{UTR} contains two non-overlapping upstream open reading frames ({uORFs}),
 whereas the mouse version contains two overlapping and out of frame {uORFs}.
 Using 5′{UTR} {GADD}34 reporter constructs, we show that the
 downstream {uORF} mediates repression of basal translation and directs
 translation during {eIF}2α phosphorylation. Furthermore, we show that the
 upstream {uORF} is poorly translated and that a proportion of scanning ribosomes
 bypasses the upstream {uORF} to recognize the downstream {uORF}. These findings
 suggest that {GADD}34 translation is regulated by a unique 5′{UTR}
 {uORF} mechanism to ensure proper {GADD}34 expression during {eIF}2α
 phosphorylation. This mechanism may serve as a model for understanding how
 other 5′{UTR} {uORF}-containing {mRNAs} are regulated during cellular
 stress.},

Preferentially translated {GADD}34 ({PPP}1R15A) and constitutively expressed {CReP} ({PPP}1R15B) function to dephosphorylate {eIF}2α-P and restore protein synthesis. The 5′-leaders of {GADD}34 and {CReP} contain two upstream {ORFs} ({uORFs}). Using biochemical and genetic approaches we show that features of these {uORFs} are central for their differential expression. In the absence of stress, translation of an inhibitory {uORF} in {GADD}34 acts as a barrier that prevents reinitiation at the {GADD}34 coding region. Enhanced {eIF}2α-P during stress directs ribosome bypass of the {uORF}, facilitating translation of the {GADD}34 coding region. {CReP} expression occurs independent of {eIF}2α-P via an {uORF} that allows for translation reinitiation at the {CReP} coding region independent of stress. Importantly, alterations in the {GADD}34 {uORF} affect the status of {eIF}2α-P, translational control, and cell adaptation to stress.

For most genes, the majority of {mRNA} molecules were associated with ribosomes and presumably engaged in translation. This systematic approach enabled us to recognize genes with unusual behavior. For 43 genes, most {mRNA} molecules were not associated with ribosomes, suggesting that they may be translationally controlled. For 53 genes, including {GCN}4, {CPA}1, and {ICY}2, three genes for which translational control is known to play a key role in regulation, most {mRNA} molecules were associated with a single ribosome. The number of ribosomes associated with {mRNAs} increased with increasing length of the putative protein-coding sequence, consistent with longer transit times for ribosomes translating longer coding sequences. The density at which ribosomes were distributed on each {mRNA} (i.e., the number of ribosomes per unit {ORF} length) was well below the maximum packing density for nearly all {mRNAs}, consistent with initiation as the rate-limiting step in translation. Global analysis revealed an unexpected correlation: Ribosome density decreases with increasing {ORF} length. Models to account for this surprising observation are discussed.},

Furthermore, a small molecule that exhibits a preference for {RNA} G-quadruplexes rather than {DNA} G-quadruplexes in biophysical experiments also shows the same selectivity within a cellular context. Our findings provide substantive evidence for {RNA} G-quadruplex formation in the human transcriptome, and corroborate the selectivity and application of stabilizing ligands that target G-quadruplexes within a cellular context.},

	abstract = {Human {mRNA} {DeXD}/H-box helicases are ubiquitous molecular motors that are required for the majority of cellular processes that involve {RNA} metabolism. One of the most abundant is {eIF}4A, which is required during the initiation phase of protein synthesis to unwind regions of highly structured {mRNA} that would otherwise impede the scanning ribosome. Dysregulation of protein synthesis is associated with tumorigenesis, but little is known about the detailed relationships between {RNA} helicase function and the malignant phenotype in solid malignancies. Therefore, immunohistochemical analysis was performed on over 3000 breast tumors to investigate the relationship among expression of {eIF}4A1, the helicase-modulating proteins {eIF}4B, {eIF}4E and {PDCD}4, and clinical outcome. We found {eIF}4A1, {eIF}4B and {eIF}4E to be independent predictors of poor outcome in {ER}-negative disease, while in contrast, the {eIF}4A1 inhibitor {PDCD}4 was related to improved outcome in {ER}-positive breast cancer. Consistent with these data, modulation of {eIF}4A1, {eIF}4B and {PCDC}4 expression in cultured {MCF}7 cells all restricted breast cancer cell growth and cycling. The {eIF}4A1-dependent translatome of {MCF}7 cells was defined by polysome profiling, and was shown to be highly enriched for several classes of oncogenic genes, including G-protein constituents, cyclins and protein kinases, and for {mRNAs} with G/C-rich 5'{UTRs} with potential to form G-quadruplexes and with 3'{UTRs} containing {microRNA} target sites. Overall, our data show that dysregulation of {mRNA} unwinding contributes to the malignant phenotype in breast cancer via preferential translation of a class of genes involved in pro-oncogenic signaling at numerous levels. Furthermore, immunohistochemical tests are promising biomarkers for tumors sensitive to anti-helicase therapies.},

	abstract = {Pancreatic cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. However, its toll is higher in more developed countries. Reasons for vast differences in mortality rates of pancreatic cancer are not completely clear yet, but it may be due to lack of appropriate diagnosis, treatment and cataloging of cancer cases. Because patients seldom exhibit symptoms until an advanced stage of the disease, pancreatic cancer remains one of the most lethal malignant neoplasms that caused 432,242 new deaths in 2018 ({GLOBOCAN} 2018 estimates). Globally, 458,918 new cases of pancreatic cancer have been reported in 2018, and 355,317 new cases are estimated to occur until 2040. Despite advancements in the detection and management of pancreatic cancer, the 5-year survival rate still stands at 9\% only. To date, the causes of pancreatic carcinoma are still insufficiently known, although certain risk factors have been identified, such as tobacco smoking, diabetes mellitus, obesity, dietary factors, alcohol abuse, age, ethnicity, family history and genetic factors, Helicobacter pylori infection, non-O blood group and chronic pancreatitis. In general population, screening of large groups is not considered useful to detect the disease at its early stage, although newer techniques and the screening of tightly targeted groups (especially of those with family history), are being evaluated. Primary prevention is considered of utmost importance. Up-to-date statistics on pancreatic cancer occurrence and outcome along with a better understanding of the etiology and identifying the causative risk factors are essential for the primary prevention of this disease.World J Oncol. 2019;10(1):10-27doi: https://doi.org/10.14740/wjon1166},

	abstract = {Background
In recent years, new treatment options have become available for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma ({PDAC}) including 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. The impact hereof has not been assessed in nationwide cohort studies. This population-based study aimed to investigate nationwide trends in incidence, treatment and survival of {PDAC}.
Materials and methods
Patients with {PDAC} (1997–2016) were included from the Netherlands Cancer Registry. Results were categorised by treatment and by period of diagnosis (1997–2000, 2001–2004, 2005–2008, 2009–2012 and 2013–2016). Kaplan–Meier survival analysis was used to calculate overall survival.
Results
In a national cohort of 36,453 patients with {PDAC}, the incidence increased from 12.1 (1997–2000) to 15.3 (2013–2016) per 100,000 (p {\textless} 0.001), whereas median overall survival increased from 3.1 to 3.8 months (p {\textless} 0.001). Over time, the resection rate doubled (8.3\%–16.6\%, p-trend{\textless}0.001), more patients received adjuvant chemotherapy (3.0\%–56.2\%, p-trend{\textless}0.001) and 3-year overall survival following resection increased (16.9\%–25.4\%, p {\textless} 0.001). Over time, the proportion of patients with metastatic disease who received palliative chemotherapy increased from 5.3\% to 16.1\% (p-trend{\textless}0.001), whereas 1-year survival improved from 13.3\% to 21.2\% (p {\textless} 0.001). The proportion of patients who only received supportive care decreased from 84\% to 61\% (p-trend{\textless}0.001).
Conclusion
The incidence of {PDAC} increased in the past two decades. Resection rates and use of adjuvant or palliative chemotherapy increased with improved survival in these patients. In all patients with {PDAC}, however, the survival benefit of 3 weeks is negligible because the majority of patients only received supportive care.},

Cessation of Pdx1 expression at increasingly later gestational times blocked pancreatic development at progressive and morphologically distinct stages and provided the opportunity to assess the requirement for Pdx1 at each stage. Embryonic {PDX}1 is depleted below effective levels within 1 day of the initiation of doxycycline treatment of pregnant mice. We show that {PDX}1, which is necessary for early pancreatic development, is also required later for the genesis of acinar tissue, the compartment of the pancreas that produces digestive enzymes. Without {PDX}1, acini do not form; the precursor epithelium continues to grow and branch, creating a truncated ductal tree comprising immature duct-like cells. The {bHLH} factor {PTF}1a, a critical regulator of acinar development, is not expressed and cells producing digestive enzymes are rare. This approach should be generally applicable to study the in vivo functions of other developmental regulators with multiple, temporally distinct roles.},

This review explores and summarizes the existing intrinsic subtypes, patient clinical features and management, commercial signature panels, as well as various information used for tumor classification.

The list of disease-causing mutations is expanding rapidly, and mutations affecting {mRNA} translation are no exception. Translation (protein synthesis) is one of the most complex processes in the cell. The orchestrated action of ribosomes, {tRNAs} and numerous translation factors decodes the information contained in {mRNA} into a polypeptide chain. The intricate nature of this process renders it susceptible to deregulation at multiple levels. In this Review, we summarize current evidence of translation deregulation in human diseases other than cancer. We discuss translation-related diseases on the basis of the molecular aberration that underpins their pathogenesis (including {tRNA} dysfunction, ribosomopathies, deregulation of the integrated stress response and deregulation of the {mTOR} pathway) and describe how deregulation of translation generates the phenotypic variability observed in these disorders.},

The presented protocol simplified the previously published ones and moreover produces tags that are 27 nucleotides long, which facilitates mapping to the genome. The protocol takes less than 5 days to complete and presents a notable improvement compared to previously published versions.},

	abstract = {Post-transcriptional gene regulation frequently occurs through elements in {mRNA} 3' untranslated regions ({UTRs}). Although crucial roles for 3'{UTR}-mediated gene regulation have been found in Caenorhabditis elegans, most C. elegans genes have lacked annotated 3'{UTRs}. Here we describe a high-throughput method for reliable identification of polyadenylated {RNA} termini, and we apply this method, called poly(A)-position profiling by sequencing (3P-Seq), to determine C. elegans 3'{UTRs}. Compared to standard methods also recently applied to C. elegans {UTRs}, 3P-Seq identified 8,580 additional {UTRs} while excluding thousands of shorter {UTR} isoforms that do not seem to be authentic. Analysis of this expanded and corrected data set suggested that the high A/U content of C. elegans 3'{UTRs} facilitated genome compaction, because the elements specifying cleavage and polyadenylation, which are A/U rich, can more readily emerge in A/U-rich regions. Indeed, 30\% of the protein-coding genes have {mRNAs} with alternative, partially overlapping end regions that generate another 10,480 cleavage and polyadenylation sites that had gone largely unnoticed and represent potential evolutionary intermediates of progressive {UTR} shortening. Moreover, a third of the convergently transcribed genes use palindromic arrangements of bidirectional elements to specify {UTRs} with convergent overlap, which also contributes to genome compaction by eliminating regions between genes. Although nematode 3'{UTRs} have median length only one-sixth that of mammalian 3'{UTRs}, they have twice the density of conserved {microRNA} sites, in part because additional types of seed-complementary sites are preferentially conserved. These findings reveal the influence of cleavage and polyadenylation on the evolution of genome architecture and provide resources for studying post-transcriptional gene regulation.},
