  abstract = {Biological characteristics of breast cancer in obese patients were investigated in comparison with non-obese patients. 134 patients with breast cancer were divided into three categories; thin, normal and obese based upon the height and weight. Five-year survival rate was 55.6\% in the obese patients, whereas it was 79.9\% in the non-obese patients including thin and normal subjects. A cause for unfavorable prognosis in the obese patients with breast cancer was clinically and histologically investigated. It was found that in the obese patients primary tumor, regional lymph node engorgement and clinical stage were relatively advanced, scirrhous carcinoma was predominant ( 46\%), tumor margin was more infiltrattive (gamma type 64\%), the incidence of vascular involvement was high (73\%), lymph node metastasis was also frequent (58\%) and nuclear grade was low.},

  abstract = {The polyribosomes newly formed on recombinant GFP-encoding mRNAs in a wheat germ cell-free translation system were analyzed using cryo-electron tomography, with sub-tomogram averaging of polysomal ribosomes and reconstruction of 3D structures of individual polyribosomes. The achieved level of resolution in the reconstructed polyribosomes allowed deducing the mRNA path by connecting adjacent exit and entry sites at the ribosomes inside each polyribosome. In this way, the circularity of a significant fraction (about 50\%) of translating polyribosomes was proved in the case of the capped poly(A)-tailed mRNA, in agreement with the existing paradigm of the circularization via interaction of cap-bound initiation factor eIF4F with poly(A)-binding protein. However, translation of the capped mRNA construct without poly(A) tail, but with unspecific 3′-UTR derived from non-coding plasmid sequence, also led to the formation of circular polyribosomes in similar proportion (40\%). Moreover, the polyribosomes formed on the uncapped non-polyadenylated mRNA with non-synergistic 5′- and 3′-UTRs proved to be circular as well, and appeared in the same proportion as in the previous cases. Thus, the formation of circular polyribosomes was found to be virtually independent of the presence of cap structure and poly(A) tail in mRNA, in contrast to the longstanding paradigm in the field.},

The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease.},

  abstract = {Eukaryotic translation termination is triggered by peptide release factors eRF1 and eRF3. Whereas eRF1 recognizes all three termination codons and induces hydrolysis of peptidyl tRNA, eRF3's function remains obscure. Here, we reconstituted all steps of eukaryotic translation in vitro using purified ribosomal subunits; initiation, elongation, and termination factors; and aminoacyl tRNAs. This allowed us to investigate termination using pretermination complexes assembled on mRNA encoding a tetrapeptide and to propose a model for translation termination that accounts for the cooperative action of eRF1 and eRF3 in ensuring fast release of nascent polypeptide. In this model, binding of eRF1, eRF3, and GTP to pretermination complexes first induces a structural rearrangement that is manifested as a 2 nucleotide forward shift of the toeprint attributed to pretermination complexes that leads to GTP hydrolysis followed by rapid hydrolysis of peptidyl tRNA. Cooperativity between eRF1 and eRF3 required the eRF3 binding C-terminal domain of eRF1.},

Evidence of eIF4G and Pab1 interaction supports the notion of a closed-loop mRNP, but the mechanistic events that lead to its formation and maintenance are still unknown. Here we use toeprinting and polysome profiling assays to delineate ribosome positioning at initiator AUG codons and ribosome-mRNA association, respectively, and find that two distinct stable (resistant to cap analogue) closed-loop structures are formed during initiation in yeast cell-free extracts. The integrity of both forms requires the mRNA cap and poly(A) tail, as well as eIF4E, eIF4G, Pab1 and eIF3, and is dependent on the length of both the mRNA and the poly(A) tail. Formation of the first structure requires the 48S ribosomal complex, whereas the second requires an 80S ribosome and the termination factors eRF3/Sup35 and eRF1/Sup45. The involvement of the termination factors is independent of a termination event.},

  abstract = {Eukaryotic cells rapidly reduce protein synthesis in response to various stress conditions. This can be achieved by the phosphorylation-mediated inactivation of a key translation initiation factor, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2). However, the persistent translation of certain mRNAs is required for deployment of an adequate stress response. We carried out ribosome profiling of cultured human cells under conditions of severe stress induced with sodium arsenite. Although this led to a 5.4-fold general translational repression, the protein coding open reading frames (ORFs) of certain individual mRNAs exhibited resistance to the inhibition. Nearly all resistant transcripts possess at least one efficiently translated upstream open reading frame (uORF) that represses translation of the main coding ORF under normal conditions. Site-specific mutagenesis of two identified stress resistant mRNAs (PPP1R15B and IFRD1) demonstrated that a single uORF is sufficient for eIF2-mediated translation control in both cases. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that at least two regulatory uORFs (namely, in SLC35A4 and MIEF1) encode functional protein products.},

This review will focus on how recent findings made with RiboSeq have revealed important details of the molecular mechanisms of translation in eukaryotes. These include mRNA translation sensitivity to drugs affecting translation initiation and elongation, the roles of upstream ORFs in response to stress, the dynamics of elongation and termination as well as details of intrinsic ribosome behavior on the mRNA after translation termination.

Deregulation of the IGF signaling pathway frequently occurs in human cancer and involves the establishment of autocrine loops comprising IGF-1 or -2 and/or IGF-1R over-expression. Epidemiologic studies have documented a link between elevated IGF levels and the development of solid tumors, such as breast, colon and prostate cancer. Anticancer strategies targeting the IGF signaling system involve two main approaches, namely neutralizing antibodies and small molecule inhibitors of the IGF-1R kinase activity. There are numerous reports describing anti-tumor activity of these agents in pre-clinical models of major human cancers. In addition, multiple clinical trials have started to evaluate the safety and efficacy of selected IGF-1R inhibitors, in combination with standard chemotherapeutic regimens or other targeted agents in cancer patients. In this Mini Review, I will discuss the role of the IGF signaling system in human cancer and the main strategies which have been so far evaluated to target the IGF-1R.},

In contrast, our understanding of how translational regulation evolves has lagged far behind. Here we have applied ribosome profiling--which measures both global mRNA levels and their translation rates--to two species of Saccharomyces yeast and their interspecific hybrid in order to assess the relative contributions of changes in mRNA abundance and translation to regulatory evolution. We report that both cis- and trans-acting regulatory divergence in translation are abundant, affecting at least 35\% of genes. The majority of translational divergence acts to buffer changes in mRNA abundance, suggesting a widespread role for stabilizing selection acting across regulatory levels. Nevertheless, we observe evidence of lineage-specific selection acting on several yeast functional modules, including instances of reinforcing selection acting at both levels of regulation. Finally, we also uncover multiple instances of stop-codon readthrough that are conserved between species. Our analysis reveals the underappreciated complexity of post-transcriptional regulatory divergence and indicates that partitioning the search for the locus of selection into the binary categories of "coding" versus "regulatory" may overlook a significant source of selection, acting at multiple regulatory levels along the path from genotype to phenotype.},

Here we analyze three independent yeast riboprofiling data sets, including two with much higher coverage than previously available, and find that all three show substantial technical sequence biases that confound interpretations of ribosomal occupancy. After accounting for these biases, we find no effect of previously implicated factors on ribosomal pausing. Rather, we find that incorporation of proline, whose unique side-chain stalls peptide synthesis in vitro, also slows the ribosome in vivo. We also reanalyze a method that implicated positively charged amino acids as the major determinant of ribosomal stalling and demonstrate that it produces false signals of stalling in low-coverage data. Our results suggest that any analysis of riboprofiling data should account for sequencing biases and sparse coverage. To this end, we establish a robust methodology that enables analysis of ribosome profiling data without prior assumptions regarding which positions spanned by the ribosome cause stalling.},

  abstract = {The largest of the mammalian translation initiation factors, eIF3, consists of at least eight subunits ranging in mass from 35 to 170 kDa. eIF3 binds to the 40 S ribosome in an early step of translation initiation and promotes the binding of methionyl-tRNAi and mRNA. We report the cloning and characterization of human cDNAs encoding two of its subunits, p110 and p36. It was found that the second slowest band during polyacrylamide gel electrophresis of eIF3 subunits in sodium dodecyl sulfate contains two proteins: p110 and p116. Analysis of the cloned cDNA encoding p110 indicates that its amino acid sequence is 31\% identical to that of the yeast protein, Nip1. The p116 cDNA was cloned and characterized as a human homolog of yeast Prt1, as described elsewhere (Méthot, N., Rom, E., Olsen, H., and Sonenberg, N. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 1110-1116). p36 is a WD40 repeat protein, which is 46\% identical to the p39 subunit of yeast eIF3 and is identical to TRIP-1, a phosphorylation substrate of the TGF-β type II receptor. The p116, p110, and p36 subunits localize on 40 S ribosomes in cells active in translation and co-immunoprecipitate with affinity-purified antibodies against the p170 subunit, showing that these proteins are integral components of eIF3. Although p36 and p116 have homologous protein subunits in yeast eIF3, the p110 homolog, Nip1, is not detected in yeast eIF3 preparations. The results indicate both conservation and diversity in eIF3 between yeast and humans.},

  abstract = {Translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) bound to GTP transfers the initiator methionyl tRNA to the 40S ribosomal subunit. The eIF5 stimulates GTP hydrolysis by the eIF2/GTP/Met-tRNAi Met ternary complex on base-pairing between Met-tRNAi Met and the start codon. The eIF2, eIF5, and eIF1 all have been implicated in stringent selection of AUG as the start codon. The eIF3 binds to the 40S ribosome and promotes recruitment of the ternary complex; however, physical contact between eIF3 and eIF2 has not been observed. We show that yeast eIF5 can bridge interaction in vitro between eIF3 and eIF2 by binding simultaneously to the amino terminus of eIF3 subunit NIP1 and the amino-terminal half of eIF2β, dependent on a conserved bipartite motif in the carboxyl terminus of eIF5. Additionally, the amino terminus of NIP1 can bind concurrently to eIF5 and eIF1. These findings suggest the occurrence of an eIF3/eIF1/eIF5/eIF2 multifactor complex, which was observed in cell extracts free of 40S ribosomes and found to contain stoichiometric amounts of tRNAi Met. The multifactor complex was disrupted by the tif5-7A mutation in the bipartite motif of eIF5. Importantly, the tif5-7A mutant is temperature sensitive and displayed a substantial reduction in translation initiation at the restrictive temperature. We propose that the multifactor complex is an important intermediate in translation initiation in vivo.},

  abstract = {TOP mRNAs are vertebrate transcripts which contain a 5′ terminal oligopyrimidine tract (5′ TOP), encode for ribosomal proteins and elongation factors 1α and 2, and are candidates for growth-dependent translational control mediated through their 5′ TOP. In the present study we show that elongation factor 2 (EF2) mRNA is translationally regulated in a growth-dependent manner in cells of hematopoietic origin, but not in any of three different non-hematopoietic cell lines studied. Human β1-tubulin mRNA is a new member of the family which contains all the hallmarks of a typical TOP mRNA, yet its translation is refractory to growth arrest of any of the examined cell lines. Transfection experiments indicate that the first 29 and 53 nucleotides of the mRNAs encoding EF2 and β1-tubulin, respectively, contain all the translational cis -regulatory elements sufficient for ubiquitously conferring growth-dependent translational control on a reporter mRNA. These results suggest that the distinct translational regulation of TOP mRNAs reflects downstream sequences which can override the regulatory features of the 5′ TOP in a cell type-specific manner. This notion is further supported by the fact that mutations within the region immediately downstream of the 5′ TOP of rpS16 mRNA confer onto the resulting transcripts growth-dependent translational control with a cell type specificity similar to that displayed by EF2 mRNA.},

Squamous tumours are enriched for TP53 and KDM6A mutations, upregulation of the TP63∆N transcriptional network, hypermethylation of pancreatic endodermal cell-fate determining genes and have a poor prognosis. Pancreatic progenitor tumours preferentially express genes involved in early pancreatic development (FOXA2/3, PDX1 and MNX1). ADEX tumours displayed upregulation of genes that regulate networks involved in KRAS activation, exocrine (NR5A2 and RBPJL), and endocrine differentiation (NEUROD1 and NKX2-2). Immunogenic tumours contained upregulated immune networks including pathways involved in acquired immune suppression.

  abstract = {The insulin receptor (IR) and type 1 insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) receptor (IGFR) are both widely expressed in mammalian tissues, and are known to be capable of heteromeric assembly as insulin/IGF hybrid receptors, in addition to the classically described receptors. By selective immunoadsorption of radioligand/receptor complexes and by immunoblotting we have determined the fraction of insulin receptors and IGF receptors occurring as hybrids in different tissues. Microsomal membranes were isolated from tissue homogenates and solubilized with Triton X-100. Solubilized receptors were incubated with 125I-IGF-I, and radioligand/receptor complexes bound by IR-specific and IGFR-specific monoclonal antibodies were quantified. The fraction of IGF-I binding sites behaving as hybrids (anti-IR-bound/anti-IGFR-bound) was approx. 40\% in liver and spleen, 70\% in placenta, and 85-90\% in skeletal muscle and heart, similar results being obtained in rabbit and human tissues. There was no correlation between the proportion of hybrids and the ratio of 125I-insulin/125I-IGF-I binding in different tissues. The fraction of 125I-insulin bound to hybrids was too low for accurate quantification, because of the relatively low affinity of hybrids for insulin. The fraction of insulin receptors present in hybrids was therefore determined by immunoblotting. Receptors in solubilized human placental microsomal membranes were precipitated with IR-specific or IGFR-specific monoclonal antibodies, and after SDS/PAGE, blots were prepared and probed with IR-specific and IGFR-specific antisera. It was found that 15\% of IR and 80\% of IGFR were present in hybrids. Consistent with these figures, the overall level of IR was estimated, by blotting with the respective antibodies at concentrations shown to give equal signals with equal amounts of receptor, to be 4-fold greater than IGFR. Overall it was concluded that a significant fraction of both IR and IGFR occurs as hybrids in most mammalian tissues, including those that are recognized targets of insulin and IGF action. The fraction of hybrids in different tissues was not a simple function of the relative levels of IR and IGFR, possibly because of heterogeneity of receptor expression in different cell types. However, in placenta the proportions of IR, IGFR and hybrids were consistent with a process of random assembly reflecting the molar ratio of IR and IGFR half-receptors.},

Although much attention has focused on microRNAs as regulators of mRNA stability/translation, recent data have highlighted the role of several diverse classes of AU-rich RNA-binding protein in the regulation of mRNA decay/stabilization. AU-rich elements are found in the 3'-untranslated region of many mRNAs that encode regulators of cell growth and survival, such as cytokines and onco/tumor-suppressor proteins. These are targeted by a burgeoning number of different RNA-binding proteins. Three distinct types of AU-rich RNA binding protein (ARE poly-U-binding degradation factor-1/AUF1, Hu antigen/HuR/HuA/ELAVL1, and the tristetraprolin/ZFP36 family of proteins) are essential for normal hematopoiesis. Together with 2 further AU-rich RNA-binding proteins, nucleolin and KHSRP/KSRP, the functions of these proteins are intimately associated with pathways that are dysregulated in various hematopoietic malignancies. Significantly, all of these AU-rich RNA-binding proteins function via an interconnected network that is integrated with microRNA functions. Studies of these diverse types of RNA binding protein are providing novel insight into gene-regulatory mechanisms in hematopoiesis in addition to offering new opportunities for developing mechanism-based targeted therapeutics in leukemia and lymphoma.},

  abstract = {Purpose Activating mutations in the phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mTOR pathway are present in the majority of breast cancers and therefore are a major focus of drug development and clinical trials. Pathway mutations have been proposed as predictive biomarkers for efficacy of PI3K-targeted therapies. However, the precise contribution of distinct PI3K pathway mutations to drug sensitivity is unknown. Experimental Design We describe the creation of a physiologic human luminal breast cancer cell line model to study the phenotype of these mutations using the MCF-7 cell line. We utilized somatic cell gene targeting to “correct” PIK3CA E545K mutant alleles in MCF-7 cells to wild type sequence. The AKT1 E17K hotspot mutation was knocked in on this wild type background. Results Loss of mutant PIK3CA dramatically reduced phosphorylation of AKT proteins and several known AKT targets, but other AKT target proteins and downstream effectors of mTOR were not affected. PIK3CA wild type cells exhibited reduced proliferation in vitro and in vivo. Knock-in of the AKT1 E17K hotspot mutation on this PIK3CA wild type background restored pathway signaling, proliferation, and tumor growth in vivo. PIK3CA, but not AKT1 mutation, increased sensitivity to the PI3K inhibitor GDC-0941 and the allosteric AKT inhibitor MK-2206. Conclusions AKT1 E17K is a bona fide oncogene in a human luminal breast cancer context. Distinct PI3K pathway mutations confer differential sensitivity to drugs targeting the pathway at different points and by distinct mechanisms. These findings have implications for the use of tumor genome sequencing to assign patients to targeted therapies.},

  abstract = {Dysregulation of mRNA translation is a frequent feature of neoplasia. As the components of the translation machinery integrate almost all oncogenic signals, targeting the protein synthesis machinery holds promise for overcoming therapeutic issues associated with intra-tumour heterogeneity.Many translation initiation factors, including the subunits of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F) complex, were found to be dysregulated in various cancers. Increased eIF4E levels and/or availability for eIF4F assembly, as well as increased eIF4E phosphorylation, are observed in various malignancies and are associated with poor prognosis.Increased levels of the eIF4F complex render cancer cells resistant to chemotherapeutics (for example, doxorubicin) and targeted therapies (for example, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase–mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K–mTOR) inhibitors), suggesting that the 'addiction' of drug-resistant cancer cells to eIF4F represents a vulnerability that could be clinically exploited.Allosteric inhibitors of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1), such as rapamycin and rapamycin analogues, or rapalogues, are approved for treatment of various human cancers; however, their efficacy has been lower than expected. Active-site mTOR inhibitors (asTORi) are more potent inhibitors of mTOR, show superior anti-neoplastic effects in preclinical models, and are under investigation in clinical trials.Direct inhibition of eIF4F is being investigated in preclinical and clinical settings (for example, eIF4E antisense oligonucleotides, inhibitors of eIF4E–5′-mRNA-cap and eIF4E–eIF4G interaction, and inhibitors of eIF4A). In particular, eIF4A inhibitors display impressive anti-neoplastic effects, with efforts underway to improve their pharmacodynamics for use in the clinic.},

  abstract = {Cancer arises as a consequence of mutations in genomes of cancer cells, which over time allow them to proliferate and spread to distant sites. Large-scale sequencing of cancer genomes is revealing an increasing number of potential driver mutations that may allow specific targeting of cancer genes, proteins, and pathways. Comprehensive views of cancer genomes are also revealing enormous heterogeneity of mutation profiles, even among tumours derived from the same organs and having similar pathological characteristics. There are now many examples where mutation profiles observed in tumours have been shown to correlate with clinical features of disease, drug response, and patient outcomes. When ignored, molecular heterogeneity can lead to failures in drug development, as drugs that may have efficacy in subgroups of patients with specific molecular phenotypes may show marginal response when tested in large groups of unselected patients. This article explores issues relevant to the clinical translation of sequence-based mutation profiles in the clinical development of targeted therapies and in the future management of cancer patients.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Angiomyolipomas in patients with the tuberous sclerosis complex or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis are associated with mutations in tuberous sclerosis genes resulting in constitutive activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). The drug sirolimus suppresses mTOR signaling. METHODS: We conducted a 24-month, nonrandomized, open-label trial to determine whether sirolimus reduces the angiomyolipoma volume in patients with the tuberous sclerosis complex or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Sirolimus was administered for the first 12 months only. Serial magnetic resonance imaging of angiomyolipomas and brain lesions, computed tomography of lung cysts, and pulmonary-function tests were performed. RESULTS: Of the 25 patients enrolled, 20 completed the 12-month evaluation, and 18 completed the 24-month evaluation. The mean (+/-SD) angiomyolipoma volume at 12 months was 53.2+/-26.6\% of the baseline value (P{$<$}0.001) and at 24 months was 85.9+/-28.5\% of the baseline value (P=0.005). At 24 months, five patients had a persistent reduction in the angiomyolipoma volume of 30\% or more. During the period of sirolimus therapy, among patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis, the mean forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) increased by 118+/-330 ml (P=0.06), the forced vital capacity (FVC) increased by 390+/-570 ml (P{$<$}0.001), and the residual volume decreased by 439+/-493 ml (P=0.02), as compared with baseline values. One year after sirolimus was discontinued, the FEV1 was 62+/-411 ml above the baseline value, the FVC was 346+/-712 ml above the baseline value, and the residual volume was 333+/-570 ml below the baseline value; cerebral lesions were unchanged. Five patients had six serious adverse events while receiving sirolimus, including diarrhea, pyelonephritis, stomatitis, and respiratory infections. CONCLUSIONS: Angiomyolipomas regressed somewhat during sirolimus therapy but tended to increase in volume after the therapy was stopped. Some patients with lymphangioleiomyomatosis had improvement in spirometric measurements and gas trapping that persisted after treatment. Suppression of mTOR signaling might constitute an ameliorative treatment in patients with the tuberous sclerosis complex or sporadic lymphangioleiomyomatosis.

  abstract = {Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies due to its late diagnosis and limited response to treatment. Tractable methods to identify and interrogate pathways involved in pancreatic tumorigenesis are urgently needed. We established organoid models from normal and neoplastic murine and human pancreas tissues. Pancreatic organoids can be rapidly generated from resected tumors and biopsies, survive cryopreservation, and exhibit ductal- and disease-stage-specific characteristics. Orthotopically transplanted neoplastic organoids recapitulate the full spectrum of tumor development by forming early-grade neoplasms that progress to locally invasive and metastatic carcinomas. Due to their ability to be genetically manipulated, organoids are a platform to probe genetic cooperation. Comprehensive transcriptional and proteomic analyses of murine pancreatic organoids revealed genes and pathways altered during disease progression. The confirmation of many of these protein changes in human tissues demonstrates that organoids are a facile model system to discover characteristics of this deadly malignancy.},

  abstract = {Insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) act on highly homologous receptors, yet in vivo elicit distinct effects on metabolism and growth. To investigate how the insulin and IGF-1 receptors exert specificity in their biological responses, we assessed their role in the regulation of gene expression using three experimental paradigms: 1) preadipocytes before and after differentiation into adipocytes that express both receptors, but at different ratios; 2) insulin receptor (IR) or IGF1R knock-out preadipocytes that only express the complimentary receptor; and 3) IR/IGF1R double knock-out (DKO) cells reconstituted with the IR, IGF1R, or both. In wild-type preadipocytes, which express predominantly IGF1R, microarray analysis revealed approximately 500 IGF-1 regulated genes (p {$<$} 0.05). The largest of these were confirmed by quantitative PCR, which also revealed that insulin produced a similar effect, but with a smaller magnitude of response. After differentiation, when IR levels increase and IGF1R decrease, insulin became the dominant regulator of each of these genes. Measurement of the 50 most highly regulated genes by quantitative PCR did not reveal a single gene regulated uniquely via the IR or IGF1R using cells expressing exclusively IGF-1 or insulin receptors. Insulin and IGF-1 dose responses from 1 to 100 nm in WT, IRKO, IGFRKO, and DKO cells re-expressing IR, IGF1R, or both showed that insulin and IGF-1 produced effects in proportion to the concentration of ligand and the specific receptor on which they act. Thus, IR and IGF1R act as identical portals to the regulation of gene expression, with differences between insulin and IGF-1 effects due to a modulation of the amplitude of the signal created by the specific ligand-receptor interaction.},

There was a clear hierarchy of the responses of different energy-consuming reactions to changes in energy supply: pathways of macromolecule biosynthesis (protein synthesis and RNA/DNA synthesis) were most sensitive to energy supply, followed by sodium cycling and then calcium cycling across the plasma membrane. Mitochondrial proton leak was the least sensitive to energy supply. Control analysis was used to quantify the relative control over ATP production exerted by the individual groups of ATP-consuming reactions. Control was widely shared; no block of reactions had more than one-third of the control. A fuller control analysis showed that there appeared to be a hierarchy of control over the flux through ATP: protein synthesis \textbackslash textgreater RNA/DNA synthesis and substrate oxidation \textbackslash textgreater Na+ cycling and Ca2+ cycling \textbackslash textgreater other ATP consumers and mitochondrial proton leak. Control analysis also indicated that there was significant control over the rates of individual ATP consumers by energy supply. Each ATP consumer had strong control over its own rate but very little control over the rates of the other ATP consumers.},

Although uORFs are present in approximately half of human and mouse transcripts, no study has investigated their global impact on protein expression. Here, we report that uORFs correlate with significantly reduced protein expression of the downstream ORF, based on analysis of 11,649 matched mRNA and protein measurements from 4 published mammalian studies. Using reporter constructs to test 25 selected uORFs, we estimate that uORFs typically reduce protein expression by 30–80\%, with a modest impact on mRNA levels. We additionally identify polymorphisms that alter uORF presence in 509 human genes. Finally, we report that 5 uORF-altering mutations, detected within genes previously linked to human diseases, dramatically silence expression of the downstream protein. Together, our results suggest that uORFs influence the protein expression of thousands of mammalian genes and that variation in these elements can influence human phenotype and disease.},

  abstract = {There is accumulating evidence that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-activated pathways play important roles in cell growth and survival of BCR-ABL-transformed cells. We have previously shown that the mTOR/p70 S6 kinase (p70 S6K) pathway is constitutively activated in BCR-ABL transformed cells and that inhibition of BCR-ABL kinase activity by imatinib mesylate abrogates such activation. We now provide evidence for the existence of a novel regulatory mechanism by which BCR-ABL promotes cell proliferation, involving p70 S6K-mediated suppression of expression of programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4), a tumor suppressor protein that acts as an inhibitor of cap-dependent translation by blocking the translation initiation factor eIF4A. Our data also establish that second generation BCR-ABL kinase inhibitors block activation of p70 S6K and downstream engagement of the S6 ribosomal protein in BCR-ABL transformed cells. Moreover, PDCD4 protein expression is up-regulated by inhibition of the BCR-ABL kinase in K562 cells and BaF3/BCR-ABL transfectants, suggesting a mechanism for the generation of the proapoptotic effects of such inhibitors. Knockdown of PDCD4 expression results in reversal of the suppressive effects of nilotinib and imatinib mesylate on leukemic progenitor colony formation, suggesting an important role for this protein in the generation of antileukemic responses. Altogether, our studies identify a novel mechanism by which BCR-ABL may promote leukemic cell growth, involving sequential engagement of the mTOR/p70 S6K pathway and downstream suppression of PDCD4 expression.},

Comparisons of gene expression patterns identified correspondences of developmental stages~across species, and differences in the timing of key events during the development of the gonads. We found that the breadth of gene expression and the extent of purifying selection gradually decrease during development, whereas the amount of positive selection and expression of new genes increase. We identified differences in the temporal trajectories of expression of individual genes across species, with brain tissues showing the smallest percentage of trajectory changes, and the liver and testis showing the largest.

Unexpectedly, we find that many proteins of the HeLa mRNA interactome are highly intrinsically disordered and enriched in short repetitive amino acid motifs.

  abstract = {Background Flavaglines are a family of natural products from the genus Aglaia that exhibit anti-cancer activity in vitro and in vivo and inhibit translation initiation. They have been shown to modulate the activity of eIF4A, the DEAD-box RNA helicase subunit of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F complex, a complex that stimulates ribosome recruitment during translation initiation. One flavagline, silvestrol, is capable of modulating chemosensitivity in a mechanism-based mouse model. Methodology/Principal Findings Among a number of flavagline family members tested herein, we find that silvestrol is the more potent translation inhibitor among these. We find that silvestrol impairs the ribosome recruitment step of translation initiation by affecting the composition of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F complex. We show that silvestrol exhibits significant anticancer activity in human breast and prostate cancer xenograft models, and that this is associated with increased apoptosis, decreased proliferation, and inhibition of angiogenesis. We demonstrate that targeting translation by silvestrol results in preferential inhibition of weakly initiating mRNAs. Conclusions/Significance Our results indicate that silvestrol is a potent anti-cancer compound in vivo that exerts its activity by affecting survival pathways as well as angiogenesis. We propose that silvestrol mediates its effects by preferentially inhibiting translation of malignancy-related mRNAs. Silvestrol appears to be well tolerated in animals.},

Although variation in RNA levels, transcription factor binding, and chromatin have been explored, little is known about global variation in translation and its genetic determinants. We used ribosome profiling, RNA sequencing, and mass spectrometry to perform an integrated analysis in lymphoblastoid cell lines from a diverse group of individuals. We find significant differences in RNA, translation, and protein levels suggesting diverse mechanisms of personalized gene expression control. Combined analysis of RNA expression and ribosome occupancy improves the identification of individual protein level differences. Finally, we identify genetic differences that specifically modulate ribosome occupancy--many of these differences lie close to start codons and upstream ORFs. Our results reveal a new level of gene expression variation among humans and indicate that genetic variants can cause changes in protein levels through effects on translation.},

  abstract = {Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a lethal malignancy with limited treatment options. Although metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of many cancers, including PDA, previous attempts to target metabolic changes therapeutically have been stymied by drug toxicity and tumour cell plasticity. Here, we show that PDA cells engage an eIF4F-dependent translation program that supports redox and central carbon metabolism. Inhibition of the eIF4F subunit, eIF4A, using the synthetic rocaglate CR-1-31-B (CR-31) reduced the viability of PDA organoids relative to their normal counterparts. In vivo, CR-31 suppresses tumour growth and extends survival of genetically-engineered murine models of PDA. Surprisingly, inhibition of eIF4A also induces glutamine reductive carboxylation. As a consequence, combined targeting of eIF4A and glutaminase activity more effectively inhibits PDA cell growth both in vitro and in vivo. Overall, our work demonstrates the importance of eIF4A in translational control of pancreatic tumour metabolism and as a therapeutic target against PDA.},

Herein, we investigated whether in addition to altering transcription, L. donovani modulates host mRNA translation to establish a successful infection. Polysome-profiling revealed that one third of protein-coding mRNAs expressed in primary mouse macrophages are differentially translated upon infection with L. donovani promastigotes or amastigotes. Gene ontology analysis identified key biological processes enriched for translationally regulated mRNAs and were predicted to be either activated (e.g. chromatin remodeling and RNA metabolism) or inhibited (e.g. intracellular trafficking and antigen presentation) upon infection. Mechanistic in silico and biochemical analyses showed selective activation mTOR- and eIF4A-dependent mRNA translation, including transcripts encoding central regulators of mRNA turnover and inflammation (i.e. PABPC1, EIF2AK2, and TGF-β). L. donovani survival within macrophages was favored under mTOR inhibition but was dampened by pharmacological blockade of eIF4A. Overall, this study uncovers a vast yet selective reprogramming of the host cell translational landscape early during L. donovani infection, and suggests that some of these changes are involved in host defense mechanisms while others are part of parasite-driven survival strategies. Further in vitro and in vivo investigation will shed light on the contribution of mTOR- and eIF4A-dependent translational programs to the outcome of visceral leishmaniasis.},

Although many eukaryotes express two highly similar eIF4G isoforms, those in plants are highly divergent in size and sequence from one another and are referred to as eIF4G and eIFiso4G. Although the domain organization of eIFiso4G differs substantially from eIF4G orthologs in other species, the domain organization of plant eIF4G is largely unknown despite the fact that it is more similar in size and sequence to eIF4G of other eukaryotes. In this study, we show that eIF4G differs from eIFiso4G in that it contains two distinct interaction domains for the poly(A) binding protein (PABP) and eIF4B but is similar to eIFiso4G in having two eIF4A interaction domains. PABP and eIF4B bind the same N-terminal region of eIF4G as they do to a region C-proximal to the HEAT-1 domain in the middle domain of eIF4G, resulting in competitive binding between eIF4B and PABP to each site. eIF4G also differs from eIFiso4G in that no competitive binding was observed between PABP and eIF4A or between eIF4B and eIF4A to its HEAT-1-containing region. These results demonstrate that despite substantial differences in size, sequence, and domain organization, PABP and eIF4B bind to eIF4G and eIFiso4G competitively.},

To address this question in a dynamic system, we mapped proteomic and transcriptomic changes in mammalian cells responding to stress induced by dithiothreitol over 30 h. Specifically, we estimated the kinetic parameters for the synthesis and degradation of RNA and proteins, and deconvoluted the response patterns into common and unique to each regulatory level using a new statistical tool. Overall, the two regulatory levels were equally important, but differed in their impact on molecule concentrations. Both mRNA and protein changes peaked between two and eight hours, but mRNA expression fold changes were much smaller than those of the proteins. mRNA concentrations shifted in a transient, pulse-like pattern and returned to values close to pre-treatment levels by the end of the experiment. In contrast, protein concentrations switched only once and established a new steady state, consistent with the dominant role of protein regulation during misfolding stress. Finally, we generated hypotheses on specific regulatory modes for some genes.},

With the integration of matched RNA sequencing data, the translation efficiency (TE) of genes can be calculated to reveal translational regulation. This layer of gene-expression regulation is otherwise difficult to assess on a global scale and generally not well understood in the context of human disease. Current statistical methods to calculate differences in TE have low accuracy, cannot accommodate complex experimental designs or confounding factors, and do not categorize genes into buffered, intensified, or exclusively translationally regulated genes. This article outlines a method [referred to as deltaTE (ΔTE), standing for change in TE] to identify translationally regulated genes, which addresses the shortcomings of previous methods. In an extensive benchmarking analysis, ΔTE outperforms all methods tested. Furthermore, applying ΔTE on data from human primary cells allows detection of substantially more translationally regulated genes, providing a clearer understanding of translational regulation in pathogenic processes.

Numerous phase 3 trials of agents effective in other malignancies have failed to benefit unselected PDA populations, although patients do occasionally respond. Studies in other solid tumors have shown that heterogeneity in response is determined, in part, by molecular differences between tumors. Furthermore, treatment outcomes are improved by targeting drugs to tumor subtypes in which they are selectively effective, with breast and lung cancers providing recent examples. Identification of PDA molecular subtypes has been frustrated by a paucity of tumor specimens available for study. We have overcome this problem by combined analysis of transcriptional profiles of primary PDA samples from several studies, along with human and mouse PDA cell lines. We define three PDA subtypes: classical, quasimesenchymal and exocrine-like, and we present evidence for clinical outcome and therapeutic response differences between them. We further define gene signatures for these subtypes that may have utility in stratifying patients for treatment and present preclinical model systems that may be used to identify new subtype specific therapies.},

In transformed breast epithelial cells under hypoxia, the mTOR and S6 kinases are constitutively activated and the mTOR negative regulator tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2) protein fails to function. Gene silencing of 4E-BP1 and eEF2 kinase or TSC2 confers resistance to hypoxia inhibition of protein synthesis in immortalized breast epithelial cells. Breast cancer cells therefore acquire resistance to hypoxia by uncoupling oxygen-responsive signaling pathways from mTOR function, eliminating inhibition of protein synthesis mediated by 4E-BP1 and eEF2.},

We review a diversity of mechanisms discovered in recent years that couple the different stages of gene expression. We then speculate on the functional and evolutionary significance of this coupling and suggest certain systems-level functionalities that might be optimized via the various coupling modes. In particular, we hypothesize that coupling is often an economic strategy that allows biological systems to respond robustly and precisely to genetic and environmental perturbations.},

  abstract = {FMRP loss of function causes Fragile X syndrome (FXS) and autistic features. FMRP is a polyribosome-associated neuronal RNA-binding protein, suggesting that it plays a key role in regulating neuronal translation, but there has been little consensus regarding either its RNA targets or mechanism of action. Here, we use high-throughput sequencing of RNAs isolated by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) to identify FMRP interactions with mouse brain polyribosomal mRNAs. FMRP interacts with the coding region of transcripts encoding pre- and postsynaptic proteins and transcripts implicated in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We developed a brain polyribosome-programmed translation system, revealing that FMRP reversibly stalls ribosomes specifically on its target mRNAs. Our results suggest that loss of a translational brake on the synthesis of a subset of synaptic proteins contributes to FXS. In addition, they provide insight into the molecular basis of the cognitive and allied defects in FXS and ASD and suggest multiple targets for clinical intervention. PaperClip},

  abstract = {Cancer-associated gene expression imbalances are conventionally studied at the genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic levels. Given the relevance of translational control in determining cell phenotypes, we evaluated the translatome, i.e., the transcriptome engaged in translation, as a descriptor of the effects of genetic instability in cancer. We performed this evaluation in high-risk neuroblastomas, which are characterized by a low frequency of point mutations or known cancer-driving genes and by the presence of several segmental chromosomal aberrations that produce gene-copy imbalances that guide aggressiveness. We thus integrated genome, transcriptome, translatome and miRome profiles in a representative panel of high-risk neuroblastoma cell lines. We identified a number of genes whose genomic imbalance was corrected by compensatory adaptations in translational efficiency. The transcriptomic level of these genes was predictive of poor prognosis in more than half of cases and the genomic imbalances found in their loci were shared by 27 other tumor types. This homeostatic process is also not limited to copy number-altered genes, as we showed the translational stoichiometric rebalance of histone genes. We suggest that the translational buffering of fluctuations in these dose-sensitive transcripts is a potential driving process of neuroblastoma evolution.},

Overexpression of eIF-4E in experimental models dramatically alters cellular morphology, enhances proliferation and induces cellular transformation, tumorigenesis and metastasis. Conversely, blocking eIF-4E function by expression of antisense RNA, or overexpression of the inhibitory eIF-4E binding proteins (4E-BPs), suppresses cellular transformation, tumor growth, tumor invasiveness and metastasis. Although eIF-4E regulates the recruitment of mRNA to ribosomes, and thereby globally regulates cap-dependent protein synthesis, eIF-4E contributes to malignancy by selectively enabling the translation of a limited pool of mRNAs--those that generally encode key proteins involved in cellular growth, angiogenesis, survival and malignancy (e.g. cyclin D1, c-myc, vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloprotease 9). A deeper understanding of the role of eIF-4E in regulating the translation of the diverse gene products involved in all aspects of malignancy will improve the capacity to exploit eIF-4E as a therapeutic target and as a marker for human cancer progression.},

However, inactivation of eIF4E does not impair translation of many capped mRNAs, suggesting an unknown alternate mechanism may exist for cap-dependent but eIF4E-independent translation. We show that DAP5, an eIF4GI homolog that lacks eIF4E binding, utilizes eIF3d to facilitate cap-dependent translation of approximately 20\% of mRNAs. Genome-wide transcriptomic and translatomic analyses indicate that DAP5 is required for translation of many transcription factors and receptor capped mRNAs and their mRNA targets involved in cell survival, motility, DNA repair and translation initiation, among other mRNAs. Mass spectrometry and crosslinking studies demonstrate that eIF3d is a direct binding partner of DAP5. In vitro translation and ribosome complex studies demonstrate that DAP5 and eIF3d are both essential for eIF4E-independent capped-mRNA translation. These studies disclose a widespread and previously unknown mechanism for cap-dependent mRNA translation by DAP5-eIF3d complexes.},

Posttranscriptional modifications of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) at the wobble uridine 34 (U34) base are highly conserved and contribute to translation fidelity. Here, we show that ELP3 and CTU1/2, partner enzymes in U34 mcm5s2-tRNA modification, are up-regulated in human breast cancers and sustain metastasis. Elp3 genetic ablation strongly impaired invasion and metastasis formation in the PyMT model of invasive breast cancer. Mechanistically, ELP3 and CTU1/2 support cellular invasion through the translation of the oncoprotein DEK. As a result, DEK promotes the IRES-dependent translation of the proinvasive transcription factor LEF1. Consistently, a DEK mutant, whose codon composition is independent of U34 mcm5s2-tRNA modification, escapes the ELP3- and CTU1-dependent regulation and restores the IRES-dependent LEF1 expression. Our results demonstrate that the key role of U34 tRNA modification is to support specific translation during breast cancer progression and highlight a functional link between tRNA modification– and IRES-dependent translation during tumor cell invasion and metastasis.},

  abstract = {Post-transcriptional modifications of transfer RNAs (tRNAs) have long been recognized to play crucial roles in regulating the rate and fidelity of translation. However, the extent to which they determine global protein production remains poorly understood. Here we use quantitative proteomics to show a direct link between wobble uridine 5-methoxycarbonylmethyl (mcm5) and 5-methoxy-carbonyl-methyl-2-thio (mcm5s2) modifications catalyzed by tRNA methyltransferase 9 (Trm9) in tRNAArg(UCU) and tRNAGlu(UUC) and selective translation of proteins from genes enriched with their cognate codons. Controlling for bias in protein expression and alternations in mRNA expression, we find that loss of Trm9 selectively impairs expression of proteins from genes enriched with AGA and GAA codons under both normal and stress conditions. Moreover, we show that AGA and GAA codons occur with high frequency in clusters along the transcripts, which may play a role in modulating translation. Consistent with these results, proteins subject to enhanced ribosome pausing in yeast lacking mcm5U and mcm5s2U are more likely to be down-regulated and contain a larger number of AGA/GAA clusters. Together, these results suggest that Trm9-catalyzed tRNA modifications play a significant role in regulating protein expression within the cell.},

  abstract = {Purpose: The human ELAV (embryonic lethal abnormal vision)-like protein HuR stabilizes a certain group of cellular mRNAs that contain AU-rich elements in their 3′-untranslated region. Cell culture studies have shown that the mRNA of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 can be stabilized by HuR. Experimental Design: To investigate a possible contribution of dysregulation of mRNA stability to the progression of cancer and to overexpression of COX-2, we studied expression of HuR in 208 primary breast carcinomas by immunohistochemistry. Results: There were two different staining patterns of HuR in tumor tissue of breast carcinomas: nuclear expression was seen in 61\% of cases; and an additional cytoplasmic expression was seen in 30\% of cases. Expression of HuR was significantly associated with increased COX-2 expression; this association was particularly significant for cytoplasmic HuR expression (P {$<$} 0.0005). We further observed a significant association of cytoplasmic (P = 0.002) or nuclear HuR (P = 0.027) expression with increased tumor grade. Only 13\% of the grade 1 carcinomas showed cytoplasmic expression of HuR, compared with 46\% of the grade 3 carcinomas. There was no significant correlation between HuR expression and other clinicopathological parameters such as histological type, tumor size, or nodal status as well as patient survival. Conclusions: Our results suggest that overexpression of HuR in tumor tissue may be part of a regulatory pathway that controls the mRNA stability of several important targets in tumor biology, such as COX-2. Based on our results, additional studies are necessary to investigate whether HuR might be a potential target for molecular tumor therapy.},

  abstract = {The LARP1 proteins form an evolutionarily homogeneous subgroup of the eukaryotic superfamily of La-Motif (LAM) containing factors. Members of the LARP1 family are found in most protists, fungi, plants, and animals. We review here evidence suggesting that LARP1 are key versatile messenger RNA (mRNA)-binding proteins involved in regulating important biological processes such as gametogenesis, embryogenesis, sex determination, and cell division in animals, as well as acclimation to stress in yeasts and plants. LARP1 proteins perform all these essential tasks likely by binding to key mRNAs and regulating their stability and/or translation. In human, the impact of LARP1 over cell division and proliferation is potentially under the control of the TORC1 complex. We review data suggesting that LARP1 is a direct target of this master signaling hub. TOR-dependent LARP1 phosphorylation could specifically enhance the translation of TOP mRNAs providing a way to promote translation, growth, and proliferation. Consequently, LARP1 is found to be significantly upregulated in many malignant cell types. In plants, LARP1 was found to act as a cofactor of the heat-induced mRNA degradation process, an essential acclimation strategy leading to the degradation of more than 4500 mRNAs coding for growth and development housekeeping functions. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the LARP1 proteins (Slf1p and Sro9p) are important, among other things, for copper resistance and oxidative stress survival. LARP1 proteins are therefore emerging as critical ancient mRNA-binding factors that evolved common as well as specific targets and regulatory functions in all eukaryotic lineages.},

Expression in cultured cells of a stable PDCD4 mutant that is unable to bind βTRCP inhibited translation of an mRNA with a structured 5′UTR, resulted in smaller cell size, and slowed down cell cycle progression. We propose that regulated degradation of PDCD4 in response to mitogens allows efficient protein synthesis and consequently cell growth. A protein identified as a tumor suppressor controls overall protein synthesis rates through a translation initiation factor, promoting cell proliferation and growth.

Five multi-subunit complexes in the inner membrane of the organelle are involved in the oxidative phosphorylation required for ATP production. Thirteen subunits of these complexes are encoded by the mitochondrial genome often referred to as mtDNA. For this reason, the expression of mtDNA is vital for the assembly and functioning of the oxidative phosphorylation complexes. Defects of the mechanisms regulating mtDNA gene expression have been associated with deficiencies in assembly of these complexes, resulting in mitochondrial diseases. Recently, numerous factors involved in these processes have been identified and characterized leading to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that underlie mitochondrial diseases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Annual updates on cancer occurrence and trends in the United States are provided through collaboration between the American Cancer Society (ACS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR). This year's report highlights the increased cancer risk associated with excess weight (overweight or obesity) and lack of sufficient physical activity ({$<$}150 minutes of physical activity per week). METHODS: Data on cancer incidence were obtained from the CDC, NCI, and NAACCR; data on cancer deaths were obtained from the CDC's National Center for Health Statistics. Annual percent changes in incidence and death rates (age-standardized to the 2000 US population) for all cancers combined and for the leading cancers among men and among women were estimated by joinpoint analysis of long-term trends (incidence for 1992-2008 and mortality for 1975-2008) and short-term trends (1999-2008). Information was obtained from national surveys about the proportion of US children, adolescents, and adults who are overweight, obese, insufficiently physically active, or physically inactive. RESULTS: Death rates from all cancers combined decreased from 1999 to 2008, continuing a decline that began in the early 1990s, among men and among women in most racial and ethnic groups. Death rates decreased from 1999 to 2008 for most cancer sites, including the 4 most common cancers (lung, colorectum, breast, and prostate). The incidence of prostate and colorectal cancers also decreased from 1999 to 2008. Lung cancer incidence declined from 1999 to 2008 among men and from 2004 to 2008 among women. Breast cancer incidence decreased from 1999 to 2004 but was stable from 2004 to 2008. Incidence increased for several cancers, including pancreas, kidney, and adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, which are associated with excess weight. CONCLUSIONS: Although improvements are reported in the US cancer burden, excess weight and lack of sufficient physical activity contribute to the increased incidence of many cancers, adversely affect quality of life for cancer survivors, and may worsen prognosis for several cancers. The current report highlights the importance of efforts to promote healthy weight and sufficient physical activity in reducing the cancer burden in the United States.},

Traditional classification use morphology to divide tumors into separate categories with differing behavior and prognosis. However, there are limitations of traditional classification systems, and new molecular methods are expected to improve classification systems. Molecular subtypes of breast carcinomas have been characterized in the last 11 years, and have been studied extensively. Much of the information accumulated in recent years, and molecular taxonomy seems to be still developing and undergoing change. The main question is whether new molecular techniques such as gene expression profiling will be accepted as gold standard in determining breast cancer subtypes, and whether molecular classification is useful in specific subtypes of breast cancer as it is in ductal carcinoma (nonspecific type). In addition, critical review of the literature reveals major problems such as poor definition, lack of reproducibility and lack of quality control in current molecular techniques and classifications. Therefore, current molecular approaches are not yet used in routine clinical practice and treatment guidance since they are immature and can even lead to incorrect assessment.},

This led to a new appreciation of the key roles of tRNA modifications and tRNA modification enzymes as checkpoints for tRNA integrity and for integrating translation with other cellular functions such as transcription, primary metabolism, and stress resistance. A global survey of tRNA modification enzymes shows that the functional constraints that drive the presence of modifications are often conserved, but the solutions used to fulfill these constraints differ among different kingdoms, organisms, and species.},

Here, we quantified PTR ratios for 11,575 proteins across 29 human tissues using matched transcriptomes and proteomes. We estimated by regression the contribution of known sequence determinants of protein synthesis and degradation in addition to 45 mRNA and 3 protein sequence motifs that we found by association testing. While PTR ratios span more than 2 orders of magnitude, our integrative model predicts PTR ratios at a median precision of 3.2-fold. A reporter assay provided functional support for two novel UTR motifs, and an immobilized mRNA affinity competition-binding assay identified motif-specific bound proteins for one motif. Moreover, our integrative model led to a new metric of codon optimality that captures the effects of codon frequency on protein synthesis and degradation. Altogether, this study shows that a large fraction of PTR ratio variation in human tissues can be predicted from sequence, and it identifies many new candidate post-transcriptional regulatory elements.},

  abstract = {The messenger RNAs of many proto-oncogenes, cytokines and lymphokines are targeted for rapid degradation through AU-rich elements (AREs) located in their 3? untranslated regions (UTRs). HuR, a ubiquitously expressed member of the Elav family of RNA binding proteins, exhibits specific affinities for ARE-containing RNA sequences in vitro which correlate with their in vivo decay rates, thereby implicating HuR in the ARE-mediated degradation pathway. We have transiently transfected HuR into mouse L929 cells and observed that overexpression of HuR enhances the stability of ?-globin reporter mRNAs containing either class I or class II AREs. The increase in mRNA stability parallels the level of HuR overexpression, establishing an in vivo role for HuR in mRNA decay. Furthermore, overexpression of HuR deletion mutants lacking RNA recognition motif 3 (RRM 3) does not exert a stabilizing effect, indicating that RRM 3 is important for HuR function. We have also developed polyclonal anti-HuR antibodies. Immunofluorescent staining of HeLa and L929 cells using affinity-purified anti-HuR antibody shows that both endogenous and overexpressed HuR proteins are localized in the nucleus. By forming HeLa?L929 cell heterokaryons, we demonstrate that HuR shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Thus, HuR may initially bind to ARE-containing mRNAs in the nucleus and provide protection during and after their export to the cytoplasmic compartment.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that noninvasive precursor lesions, classified as pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), can progress to invasive pancreatic cancer. This review will discuss the major genetic alterations in PanIN lesions. METHODS: A comprehensive review of the literature was performed in order to find studies on the molecular profile of human PanIN lesions. In addition, recent publications on genetically engineered mouse models of preinvasive neoplasia and pancreatic cancers were reviewed. RESULTS: PanINs demonstrate abnormalities at the genomic (DNA), transcriptomic (RNA), and proteomic levels, and there is a progressive accumulation of molecular alterations that accompany the histological progression from low-grade PanIN-1A to high-grade PanIN-3 lesions. Molecular changes in PanINs can be classified as "early" (KRAS2 mutations, telomere shortening, p21(WAF1/CIP1) up-regulation, etc.), "intermediate" (cyclin D1 up-regulation, expression of proliferation antigens, etc.), or "late" (BRCA2 and TP53 mutations, DPC4/SMAD4/MADH4 inactivation, etc.). All the genetic changes observed in PanINs are also found in invasive ductal adenocarcinomas, where they usually occur at a higher frequency. Genetically engineered mice expressing mutant Kras in the pancreas, with or without additional genetic alterations, provide a unique in vivo platform to study the pancreatic cancer progression model. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular studies have been instrumental in establishing that PanIN lesions are the noninvasive precursors for invasive ductal adenocarcinomas. The availability of molecular date provides the basis for designing rational early detection strategies and therapeutic intervention trials before pancreatic neoplasms invade, with the intention of alleviating the dismal prognosis associated with this disease.},

However, the relationship between human transcript diversity and protein production is complex as each isoform can be translated differently. We fractionated a polysome profile and reconstructed transcript isoforms from each fraction, which we term Transcript Isoforms in Polysomes sequencing (TrIP-seq). Analysis of these data revealed regulatory features that control ribosome occupancy and translational output of each transcript isoform. We extracted a panel of 5′ and 3′ untranslated regions that control protein production from an unrelated gene in cells over a 100-fold range. Select 5′ untranslated regions exert robust translational control between cell lines, while 3′ untranslated regions can confer cell type-specific expression. These results expose the large dynamic range of transcript-isoform-specific translational control, identify isoform-specific sequences that control protein output in human cells, and demonstrate that transcript isoform diversity must be considered when relating RNA and protein levels.},

  abstract = {Control of translation allows for the production of stoichiometric levels of each protein in the cell. Attaining such a level of fine-tuned regulation of protein production requires the coordinated temporal and spatial control of numerous cellular signalling cascades impinging on the various components of the translational machinery. Foremost among these is the mTOR signalling pathway. The mTOR pathway regulates both the initiation and elongation steps of protein synthesis through the phosphorylation of numerous translation factors, while simultaneously ensuring adequate folding of nascent polypeptides through co-translational degradation of misfolded proteins. Perhaps most remarkably, mTOR is also a key regulator of the synthesis of ribosomal proteins and translation factors themselves. Two seminal studies have recently shown in translatome analysis that the mTOR pathway preferentially regulates the translation of mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and translation factors. Therefore, the role of the mTOR pathway in the control of protein synthesis extends far beyond immediate translational control. By controlling ribosome production (and ultimately ribosome availability), mTOR is a master long-term controller of protein synthesis. Herein, we review the literature spanning the early discoveries of mTOR on translation to the latest advances in our understanding of how the mTOR pathway controls the synthesis of ribosomal proteins.},

The best studied targets of mTORC1 in translation are the eukaryotic initiation factor-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase 1 (S6K1). In this study, we identify the La-related protein 1 (LARP1) as a key novel target of mTORC1 with a fundamental role in terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNA translation. Recent genome-wide studies indicate that TOP and TOP-like mRNAs compose a large portion of the mTORC1 translatome, but the mechanism by which mTORC1 controls TOP mRNA translation is incompletely understood. Here, we report that LARP1 functions as a key repressor of TOP mRNA translation downstream of mTORC1. Our data show the following: (i) LARP1 associates with mTORC1 via RAPTOR; (ii) LARP1 interacts with TOP mRNAs in an mTORC1-dependent manner; (iii) LARP1 binds the 5'TOP motif to repress TOP mRNA translation; and (iv) LARP1 competes with the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4G for TOP mRNA binding. Importantly, from a drug resistance standpoint, our data also show that reducing LARP1 protein levels by RNA interference attenuates the inhibitory effect of rapamycin, Torin1, and amino acid deprivation on TOP mRNA translation. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that LARP1 functions as an important repressor of TOP mRNA translation downstream of mTORC1.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are established regulators of development, cell identity and disease. Although nearly two thousand human miRNA genes are known and new ones are continuously discovered, no attempt has been made to gauge the total miRNA content of the human genome. RESULTS: Employing an innovative computational method on massively pooled small RNA sequencing data, we report 2,469 novel human miRNA candidates of which 1,098 are validated by in-house and published experiments. Almost 300 candidates are robustly expressed in a neuronal cell system and are regulated during differentiation or when biogenesis factors Dicer, Drosha, DGCR8 or Ago2 are silenced. To improve expression profiling, we devised a quantitative miRNA capture system. In a kidney cell system, 400 candidates interact with DGCR8 at transcript positions that suggest miRNA hairpin recognition, and 1,000 of the new miRNA candidates interact with Ago1 or Ago2, indicating that they are directly bound by miRNA effector proteins. From kidney cell CLASH experiments, in which miRNA-target pairs are ligated and sequenced, we observe hundreds of interactions between novel miRNAs and mRNA targets. The novel miRNA candidates are specifically but lowly expressed, raising the possibility that not all may be functional. Interestingly, the majority are evolutionarily young and overrepresented in the human brain. CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we present evidence that the complement of human miRNA genes is substantially larger than anticipated, and that more are likely to be discovered in the future as more tissues and experimental conditions are sequenced to greater depth.},

  abstract = {mRNA translation plays a central role in the regulation of gene expression and represents the most energy consuming process in mammalian cells. Accordingly, dysregulation of mRNA translation is considered to play a major role in a variety of pathological states including cancer. Ribosomes also host chaperones, which facilitate folding of nascent polypeptides, thereby modulating function and stability of newly synthesized polypeptides. In addition, emerging data indicate that ribosomes serve as a platform for a repertoire of signaling molecules, which are implicated in a variety of post-translational modifications of newly synthesized polypeptides as they emerge from the ribosome, and/or components of translational machinery. Herein, a well-established method of ribosome fractionation using sucrose density gradient centrifugation is described. In conjunction with the in-house developed "anota" algorithm this method allows direct determination of differential translation of individual mRNAs on a genome-wide scale. Moreover, this versatile protocol can be used for a variety of biochemical studies aiming to dissect the function of ribosome-associated protein complexes, including those that play a central role in folding and degradation of newly synthesized polypeptides.},

  abstract = {Ternary complex (TC) and eIF4F complex assembly are the two major rate-limiting steps in translation initiation regulated by eIF2α phosphorylation and the mTOR/4E-BP pathway, respectively. How TC and eIF4F assembly are coordinated, however, remains largely unknown. We show that mTOR suppresses translation of mRNAs activated under short-term stress wherein TC recycling is attenuated by eIF2α phosphorylation. During acute nutrient or growth factor stimulation, mTORC1 induces eIF2β phosphorylation and recruitment of NCK1 to eIF2, decreases eIF2α phosphorylation and bolsters TC recycling. Accordingly, eIF2β mediates the effect of mTORC1 on protein synthesis and proliferation. In addition, we demonstrate a formerly undocumented role for CK2 in regulation of translation initiation, whereby CK2 stimulates phosphorylation of eIF2β and simultaneously bolsters eIF4F complex assembly via the mTORC1/4E-BP pathway. These findings imply a previously unrecognized mode of translation regulation, whereby mTORC1 and CK2 coordinate TC and eIF4F complex assembly to stimulate cell proliferation. Ternary complex (TC) and eIF4F complex assembly are rate-limiting steps in translation initiation that are regulated by eIF2α phosphorylation and the mTOR/4E-BP pathway. Here the authors show that the protein kinases mTORC1 and CK2 coordinate TC and eIF4F complex assembly through eIF2β to stimulate cell proliferation.},

  abstract = {The diversity of MTOR-regulated mRNA translation remains unresolved. Whereas ribosome-profiling suggested that MTOR almost exclusively stimulates translation of the TOP (terminal oligopyrimidine motif) and TOP-like mRNAs, polysome-profiling indicated that MTOR also modulates translation of mRNAs without the 5′ TOP motif (non-TOP mRNAs). We demonstrate that in ribosome-profiling studies, detection of MTOR-dependent changes in non-TOP mRNA translation was obscured by low sensitivity and methodology biases. Transcription start site profiling using nano-cap analysis of gene expression (nanoCAGE) revealed that not only do many MTOR-sensitive mRNAs lack the 5′ TOP motif but that 5′ UTR features distinguish two functionally and translationally distinct subsets of MTOR-sensitive mRNAs: (1) mRNAs with short 5′ UTRs enriched for mitochondrial functions, which require EIF4E but are less EIF4A1-sensitive; and (2) long 5′ UTR mRNAs encoding proliferation- and survival-promoting proteins, which are both EIF4E- and EIF4A1-sensitive. Selective inhibition of translation of mRNAs harboring long 5′ UTRs via EIF4A1 suppression leads to sustained expression of proteins involved in respiration but concomitant loss of those protecting mitochondrial structural integrity, resulting in apoptosis. Conversely, simultaneous suppression of translation of both long and short 5′ UTR mRNAs by MTOR inhibitors results in metabolic dormancy and a predominantly cytostatic effect. Thus, 5′ UTR features define different modes of MTOR-sensitive translation of functionally distinct subsets of mRNAs, which may explain the diverse impact of MTOR and EIF4A inhibitors on neoplastic cells.},

Using this novel method, several studies have demonstrated the widespread role of short upstream reading frames in translational control as well as slower elongation at the beginning of open reading frames in response to stress. Based on the initial studies, the importance of adding or omitting translation inhibitors, such as cycloheximide, was noted as it markedly affected ribosome coverage profiles. For that reason, many recent studies omitted translation inhibitors in the culture medium. Here, we investigate the influence of ranging cycloheximide concentrations on ribosome profiles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and demonstrate that increasing the drug concentration can overcome some of the artifacts. We subjected cells to various manipulations and show that neither oxidative stress nor heat shock nor amino acid starvation affect translation elongation. Instead, the observations in the initial studies are the result of cycloheximide-inflicted artifacts. Likewise, we find little support for short upstream reading frames to be involved in widespread protein synthesis regulation under stress conditions. Our study highlights the need for better standardization of ribosome profiling methods.},

Measuring tRNA pools in various cell types, we found two distinct subsets, one that is induced in proliferating cells, and repressed otherwise, and another with the opposite signature. Correspondingly, we found that genes serving cell-autonomous functions and genes involved in multicellularity obey distinct codon usage. Proliferation-induced and differentiation-induced tRNAs often carry anticodons that correspond to the codons enriched among the cell-autonomous and the multicellularity genes, respectively. Because mRNAs of cell-autonomous genes are induced in proliferation and cancer in particular, the concomitant induction of their codon-enriched tRNAs suggests coordination between transcription and translation. Histone modifications indeed change similarly in the vicinity of cell-autonomous genes and their corresponding tRNAs, and in multicellularity genes and their tRNAs, suggesting the existence of transcriptional programs coordinating tRNA supply and demand. Hence, we describe the existence of two distinct translation programs that operate during proliferation and differentiation.},

  abstract = {The multisubunit eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4F recruits 40S ribosomal subunits to the 5′ end of mRNA. The eIF4F subunit eIF4E interacts directly with the mRNA 5′ cap structure. Assembly of the eIF4F complex is inhibited by a family of repressor polypeptides, the eIF4E-binding proteins (4E-BPs). Binding of the 4E-BPs to eIF4E is regulated by phosphorylation: Hypophosphorylated 4E-BP isoforms interact strongly with eIF4E, whereas hyperphosphorylated isoforms do not. 4E-BP1 is hypophosphorylated in quiescent cells, but is hyperphosphorylated on multiple sites following exposure to a variety of extracellular stimuli. The PI3-kinase/Akt pathway and the kinase FRAP/mTOR signal to 4E-BP1. FRAP/mTOR has been reported to phosphorylate 4E-BP1 directly in vitro. However, it is not known if FRAP/mTOR is responsible for the phosphorylation of all 4E-BP1 sites, nor which sites must be phosphorylated to release 4E-BP1 from eIF4E. To address these questions, a recombinant FRAP/mTOR protein and a FRAP/mTOR immunoprecipitate were utilized in in vitro kinase assays to phosphorylate 4E-BP1. Phosphopeptide mapping of the in vitro-labeled protein yielded two 4E-BP1 phosphopeptides that comigrated with phosphopeptides produced in vivo. Mass spectrometry analysis indicated that these peptides contain phosphorylated Thr-37 and Thr-46. Thr-37 and Thr-46 are efficiently phosphorylated in vitro by FRAP/mTOR when 4E-BP1 is bound to eIF4E. However, phosphorylation at these sites was not associated with a loss of eIF4E binding. Phosphorylated Thr-37 and Thr-46 are detected in all phosphorylated in vivo 4E-BP1 isoforms, including those that interact with eIF4E. Finally, mutational analysis demonstrated that phosphorylation of Thr-37/Thr-46 is required for subsequent phosphorylation of several carboxy-terminal serum-sensitive sites. Taken together, our results suggest that 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by FRAP/mTOR on Thr-37 and Thr-46 is a priming event for subsequent phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal serum-sensitive sites.},

DUG is constitutively expressed at very low levels in normal cells but is dramatically upregulated in apoptotic cells following serum/glucose starvation or death receptor ligation by Fas ligand. The DUG mRNA is present in two splicing forms: a long form that encodes a protein of 469 amino acids and a short form that gives rise to a polypeptide of 432 amino acids. The predicted DUG protein sequence contains two putative nuclear localization signals and multiple phosphorylation sites for protein kinases and two conserved MA3 domains. Importantly, DUG is homologous to eukaryotic translation initiation factor (eIF) 4G and binds to eIF4A presumably through MA3 domains. Upon transfection, DUG inhibits both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis. Thus, DUG is a novel homologue of eIF4G that regulates apoptosis.},

By developing a high-throughput tRNA profiling method, we find that specific tRNAs are upregulated in human breast cancer cells as they gain metastatic activity. Through loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and clinical-association studies, we implicate tRNAGluUUC and tRNAArgCCG as promoters of breast cancer metastasis. Upregulation of these tRNAs enhances stability and ribosome occupancy of transcripts enriched for their cognate codons. Specifically, tRNAGluUUC promotes metastatic progression by directly enhancing EXOSC2 expression and enhancing GRIPAP1—constituting an “inducible” pathway driven by a tRNA. The cellular proteomic shift toward a pro-metastatic state mirrors global tRNA shifts, allowing for cell-state and cell-type transgene expression optimization through codon content quantification. TRNA modulation represents a mechanism by which cells achieve altered expression of specific transcripts and proteins. TRNAs are thus dynamic regulators of gene expression and the tRNA codon landscape can causally and specifically impact disease progression.},

The fraction of tRNA isodecoder genes among all tRNA genes increases across the phylogenetic spectrum. A large number of sequence differences in human tRNA isodecoder genes occurs in the internal promoter regions for RNA polymerase III. We also describe a systematic, ligation-based method to detect and quantify tRNA isodecoder molecules in human samples, and show differential expression of three tRNA isodecoders in six human tissues.

Enhanced eIF4E function results from eIF4E overexpression and/or activation of the ras and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/AKT pathways and selectively increases the translation of key mRNAs involved in tumor growth, angiogenesis, and cell survival. Consequently, by simultaneously and selectively reducing the expression of numerous potent growth and survival factors critical for malignancy, targeting eIF4E for inhibition may provide an attractive therapy for many different tumor types. Recent work has now shown the plausibility of therapeutically targeting eIF4E and has resulted in the advance of the first eIF4E-specific therapy to clinical trials. These studies illustrate the increased susceptibility of tumor tissues to eIF4E inhibition and support the notion that the enhanced eIF4E function common to many tumor types may represent an Achilles' heel for cancer.

By immunohistochemical analyses of 148 tissues from 89 prostate cancer patients, we now show that both eIF4E expression and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation (p4E-BP1) are increased significantly, particularly in advanced prostate cancer versus benign prostatic hyperplasia tissues. Further, increased eIF4E and p4E-BP1 levels are significantly related to reduced patient survival, whereas uniform 4E-BP1 expression is significantly related to better patient survival. Both immunohistochemistry and Western blotting reveal that elevated eIF4E and p4E-BP1 are evident in the same prostate cancer tissues. In two distinct prostate cancer cell models, the progression to androgen independence also involves increased eIF4E activation. In these prostate cancer cells, reducing eIF4E expression with an eIF4E-specific antisense oligonucleotide currently in phase I clinical trials robustly induces apoptosis, regardless of cell cycle phase, and reduces expression of the eIF4E-regulated proteins BCL-2 and c-myc. Collectively, these data implicate eIF4E activation in prostate cancer and suggest that targeting eIF4E may be attractive for prostate cancer therapy.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}A reconstituted reticulocyte translation system originally designed to be deficient in eukaryotic initiation factor 4B (eIF-4B) was used to identify a new activity required for maximal synthesis of rabbit globin. This new activity purifies as a stable, high molecular weight complex by a variety of chromatographic procedures and is termed eIF-4F. The purified globin stimulatory activity also restores translation of capped mRNAs in extracts of poliovirus-infected HeLa cells. Like restoring activity that was obtained as a protein complex by different procedures (Tahara, S. M., Morgan, M. A. and Shatkin, A. J. (1981) J. Biol. Chem. 256, 791-794), eIF-4F includes the 24,000-dalton cap binding protein and major polypeptides of Mr approximately 200,000 and approximately 46,000. The latter component comigrates with eIF-4A by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and, like eIF-4A, chemically cross-links to the 5'-end of capped mRNA by an ATP-dependent, m7GDP-sensitive reaction. Unlike eIF-4F, cap binding protein of Mr approximately 24,000 isolated by affinity chromatography on m7GDP-Sepharose does not stimulate globin synthesis in the reconstituted system.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Integrated Stress Response is a homeostatic mechanism induced by endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In acute/transient ER stress, decreased global protein synthesis and increased uORF mRNA translation are followed by normalization of protein synthesis. Here, we report a dramatically different response during chronic ER stress. This chronic ISR program is characterized by persistently elevated uORF mRNA translation and concurrent gene expression reprogramming, which permits simultaneous stress sensing and proteostasis. The program includes PERK-dependent switching to an eIF3-dependent translation initiation mechanism resulting in partial but not complete translational recovery, which, together with transcriptional reprogramming, selectively bolsters expression of proteins with ER functions. Coordination of transcriptional and translational reprogramming prevents ER dysfunction and inhibits “foamy cell” development, thus establishing a molecular basis for understanding human diseases associated with ER dysfunction.,  , Guan et al. unravel the mechanism of adaptation to chronic stress which encompasses previously unappreciated remodeling of the translation initiation machinery guided by PERK. These changes in the translation machinery are coordinated with stress-induced transcriptional reprograming and when disrupted result in a foamy cell phenotype and cell death.},

  abstract = {Transcriptional silencing that begins with oocyte maturation persists during the initial mitotic divisions of the embryo. Gene expression during this period largely depends on the translational activation of maternal mRNAs by cytoplasmic polyadenylation and requires an embryonic poly(A) binding protein (EPAB). EPAB has been identified in Xenopus and mouse, where it is expressed exclusively in oocytes and early embryos until zygotic genome activation (ZGA) when it is replaced by the somatic cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein (PABPC1). EPAB plays a central role in the regulation of maternal mRNA activation by preventing deadenylation and promoting translation. In this study, we identified and characterized the human EPAB ortholog. Human EPAB is a 619 amino acid protein with 77\% identity and 84\% similarity to mouse EPAB. Human EPAB mRNA is detected in ovaries, testes and several somatic tissues including pancreas, liver and thymus. Similar to the observations in Xenopus and mouse, human EPAB is the predominant poly(A) binding protein in immature (germinal vesicle) and mature (metaphase II) oocytes, and it is replaced by PABPC1 following ZGA, which occurs at 4- to 8-cell stage in human. Our findings suggest that the unique translational regulatory pathways that control gene expression during oogenesis and early embryo development may be common between model organisms and humans.},

In mammalian cells, this effect is achieved in part through a co-ordinated inhibition of RP (ribosomal protein) synthesis. More specifically, translation initiation on RP mRNAs is inhibited. Translational regulation of RP synthesis is dependent on cis-elements within the 5′-UTRs (5′-untranslated regions) of the RP mRNAs. In particular, a highly conserved 5′-TOP (5′-terminal oligopyrimidine tract) appears to play a key role in the regulation of RP mRNA translation. This article explores recent developments in our understanding of the mechanism of TOP mRNA regulation, focusing on upstream signalling pathways and trans-acting factors, and highlighting some interesting observations which have come to light following the recent development of cDNA microarray technology coupled with polysome analysis.},

They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list - reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the "tumor microenvironment."

IR binds insulin at the cell surface and transduces rapid signaling via cytoplasmic kinases. However, mechanisms mediating long-term effects of insulin remain unclear. Here, we show that IR associates with RNA polymerase II in the nucleus, with striking enrichment at promoters genome-wide. The target genes were highly enriched for insulin-related functions including lipid metabolism and protein synthesis and diseases including diabetes, neurodegeneration, and cancer. IR chromatin binding was increased by insulin and impaired in an insulin-resistant disease model. Promoter binding by IR was mediated by coregulator host cell factor-1 (HCF-1) and transcription factors, revealing an HCF-1-dependent pathway for gene regulation by insulin. These results show that IR interacts with transcriptional machinery at promoters and identify a pathway regulating genes linked to insulin’s effects in physiology and disease.},

We studied whether this represents a mechanism for reducing energy consumption or whether it is the consequence of metabolic dysfunction. Oxygen consumption (JO2) of A549 cells and primary rat alveolar type II cells was measured by microrespirometry during normoxia, hypoxia (1.5\% O2), and reoxygenation. In both cell types, acute and 24-h hypoxia decreased total JO2 significantly and reoxygenation restored JO2 after 5 min but not after 24 h of hypoxia in A549 cells, whereas recovery was complete in type II cells. In A549 cells under normoxia Na/K-ATPase accounted for approximately 15\% of JO2, whereas Na/K-ATPase-related JO2 was decreased by approximately 25\% in hypoxia. Inhibition of other ion transporters did not affect JO2. Protein synthesis-related JO2 was not affected by acute hypoxia, but decreased by 30\% after 24-h hypoxia. Acute and 24-h hypoxia decreased JO2 of A549 cell mitochondrial complexes I, II, and III by 30-40\%. Reoxygenation restored complex I activity after acute hypoxia but not after 24-h hypoxia. ATP was decreased 30\% after 24-h hypoxia, but lactate production rate was not affected. Reduced nicotinamine adenine dinucleotide was slightly elevated in acute hypoxia. Our findings indicate that inhibition of the Na/K-ATPase by hypoxia contributes little to energy preservation in hypoxia. It remains unclear to what extent hypoxic inhibition of mitochondrial metabolism affects ATP-consuming processes.},

The post-termination complex is then disassembled, enabling its constituents to participate in further rounds of translation. Ribosome recycling involves splitting of the 80S ribosome by the ATP-binding cassette protein ABCE1 to release the 60S subunit. Subsequent dissociation of deacylated transfer RNA (tRNA) and messenger RNA (mRNA) from the 40S subunit may be mediated by initiation factors (priming the 40S subunit for initiation), by ligatin (eIF2D) or by density-regulated protein (DENR) and multiple copies in T-cell lymphoma-1 (MCT1). These events may be subverted by suppression of termination (yielding carboxy-terminally extended read-through polypeptides) or by interruption of recycling, leading to reinitiation of translation near the stop codon.},

However, the codon?anticodon co-adaptation in humans is not completely understood, nor is its effect on tissue-specific protein levels. Here, we first validated the accuracy of small RNA-seq for tRNA quantification across five human cell lines. We then analyzed the tRNA abundance of more than 8,000 tumor samples from TCGA, together with their paired mRNA-seq and proteomics data, to determine the Supply-to-Demand Adaptation. We thereby elucidate that the dynamic adaptation of the tRNA pool is largely related to the proliferative state across tissues. The distribution of such tRNA pools over the whole cellular translatome affects the subsequent translational efficiency, which functionally determines a condition-specific expression program both in healthy and tumor states. Furthermore, the aberrant translational efficiency of some codons in cancer, exemplified by ProCCA and GlyGGT, is associated with poor patient survival. The regulation of these tRNA profiles is partly explained by the tRNA gene copy numbers and their promoter DNA methylation.},

Although eIF1 and eIF1A promote scanning, eIF1 and possibly the C-terminal tail of eIF1A must be displaced from the P decoding site to permit base-pairing between Met-tRNAi and the AUG codon, as well as to allow subsequent phosphate release from eIF2-GDP. A second GTPase, eIF5B, catalyzes the joining of the 60S subunit to produce an 80S initiation complex that is competent for elongation.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms that govern organelle adaptation and remodelling remain poorly defined. The endo-lysosomal system degrades cargo from various routes, including endocytosis, phagocytosis, and autophagy. For phagocytes, endosomes and lysosomes (endo-lysosomes) are kingpin organelles because they are essential to kill pathogens and process and present antigens. During phagocyte activation, endo-lysosomes undergo a morphological transformation, going from a collection of dozens of globular structures to a tubular network in a process that requires the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase-AKT-mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signalling pathway. Here, we show that the endo-lysosomal system undergoes an expansion in volume and holding capacity during phagocyte activation within 2 h of lipopolysaccharides (LPS) stimulation. Endo-lysosomal expansion was paralleled by an increase in lysosomal protein levels, but this was unexpectedly largely independent of the transcription factor EB (TFEB) and transcription factor E3 (TFE3), which are known to scale up lysosome biogenesis. Instead, we demonstrate a hitherto unappreciated mechanism of acute organelle expansion via mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1)-dependent increase in translation, which appears to be mediated by both S6Ks and 4E-BPs. Moreover, we show that stimulation of RAW 264.7 macrophage cell line with LPS alters translation of a subset but not all of mRNAs encoding endo-lysosomal proteins, thereby suggesting that endo-lysosome expansion is accompanied by functional remodelling. Importantly, mTORC1-dependent increase in translation activity was necessary for efficient and rapid antigen presentation by dendritic cells. Collectively, we identified a previously unknown and functionally relevant mechanism for endo-lysosome expansion that relies on mTORC1-dependent translation to stimulate endo-lysosome biogenesis in response to an infection signal.},

This phase I study sought an appropriate LY2275796 dose in patients with advanced tumors. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A 3-day loading dose, then weekly maintenance doses, were given to 1 to 3 patient cohorts, beginning with 100 mg and escalating. Plasma samples were collected to determine LY2275796 concentrations and tumor biopsies to quantify eIF-4E mRNA/protein. RESULTS: Thirty patients with stage 4 disease received 1 or more LY2275796 dose. A dose-limiting toxicity was observed at 1,200 mg, with 1,000 mg the maximum-tolerated dose. Across all dose levels, most patients (87\%) had only grade 1 to 2 toxicities. LY2275796 pharmacokinetics supported the dosing regimen. Comparison of pre- and postdose biopsies showed eIF-4E decreased in most patients. Fifteen patients had progressive disease, and 7 patients achieved stable disease (minimum of 6 weeks) as best response, with 2 patients on therapy for more than 3 months (one with melanoma, one with cystadenocarcinoma of the head/neck). CONCLUSIONS: LY2275796 was well tolerated up to 1,000 mg. Because tumor eIF-4E expression was decreased, but no tumor response observed, LY2275796 should be studied combined with other treatment modalities.},

  abstract = {Mutations in PIK3CA, encoding the insulin-activated phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K), and loss of function mutations in PTEN, a phosphatase that degrades the phosphoinositide lipids generated by PI3K, are among the most frequent events in human cancers,. Yet, pharmacological inhibition of PI3K has resulted in variable clinical responses, raising the possibility of an inherent mechanism of resistance. Since the PIK3CA-encoded enzyme, p110α, mediates virtually all cellular responses to insulin, targeted inhibition of this enzyme disrupts glucose metabolism in multiple tissue types. For example, blocking insulin signaling promotes glycogen breakdown in the liver and prevents glucose uptake in the skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, resulting in transient hyperglycemia that occurs within a few hours of PI3K inhibition. The effect is usually transient because compensatory insulin release from the pancreas (i.e. insulin feedback) restores normal glucose homeostasis. However, the hyperglycemia may be exacerbated or prolonged in patients with any degree of insulin resistance and, in these cases, requires discontinuation of therapy–. We hypothesized that insulin feedback induced by PI3K inhibitors may be reactivating the PI3K-mTOR signaling axis in tumors, compromising their effectiveness,. Here, we show in several model tumors, that systemic glucose-insulin feedback caused by targeted inhibition of this pathway is sufficient to activate PI3K signaling, even in the presence of PI3K inhibitors. We demonstrate that this insulin feedback can be prevented using dietary or pharmaceutical approaches, which greatly enhance the efficacy/toxicity ratios of these compounds. These findings have direct clinical implications for the multiple p110α inhibitors that are in clinical trials and provide a means to significantly increase treatment efficacy for patients with a myriad of tumor types.},

While phosphorylation of rpS6 is dispensable for cancer formation, 4EBP-eIF4E exerts significant control over cap-dependent translation, cell growth, cancer initiation, and progression. This effect is mediated at least in part through 4EBP-dependent control of Mcl-1 expression, a key antiapoptotic protein. By using an active site inhibitor of mTOR, PP242, we show a marked therapeutic response in rapamycin-resistant tumors. The therapeutic benefit of PP242 is mediated through inhibition of mTORC1-dependent 4EBP-eIF4E hyperactivation. Thus, the 4EBP-eIF4E axis downstream of mTOR is a druggable mediator of translational control and Akt-mediated tumorigenesis that has important implications for the treatment of human cancers.},

Furthermore, we develop a clinically relevant ATP site inhibitor of mTOR, INK128, which reprograms this gene expression signature with therapeutic benefit for prostate cancer metastasis, for which there is presently no cure.

By interacting with the translation initiation factor eIF3, Cpeb4 represses the translation of a large set of mRNAs, including its own mRNA. Thus, transcriptional induction and translational repression combine to form a negative feedback loop to control Cpeb4 protein levels within a specific range that is required for terminal erythropoiesis. Our study provides an example of how translational control is integrated with transcriptional regulation to precisely control gene expression during mammalian cell differentiation.},

  abstract = {Ribosome profiling produces snapshots of the locations of actively translating ribosomes on messenger RNAs. These snapshots can be used to make inferences about translation dynamics. Recent ribosome profiling studies in yeast, however, have reached contradictory conclusions regarding the average translation rate of each codon. Some experiments have used cycloheximide (CHX) to stabilize ribosomes before measuring their positions, and these studies all counterintuitively report a weak negative correlation between the translation rate of a codon and the abundance of its cognate tRNA. In contrast, some experiments performed without CHX report strong positive correlations. To explain this contradiction, we identify unexpected patterns in ribosome density downstream of each type of codon in experiments that use CHX. These patterns are evidence that elongation continues to occur in the presence of CHX but with dramatically altered codon-specific elongation rates. The measured positions of ribosomes in these experiments therefore do not reflect the amounts of time ribosomes spend at each position in vivo. These results suggest that conclusions from experiments in yeast using CHX may need reexamination. In particular, we show that in all such experiments, codons decoded by less abundant tRNAs were in fact being translated more slowly before the addition of CHX disrupted these dynamics.},

PABP increases the efficiency of translation termination by recruitment of eRF3a and eRF1 to the ribosome. PABP's function in translation termination depends on its C-terminal domain and its interaction with the N-terminus of eRF3a. Interestingly, we discover that full-length eRF3a exerts a different mode of function compared to its truncated form eRF3c, which lacks the N-terminal domain. Pre-association of eRF3a, but not of eRF3c, with pre-termination complexes (preTCs) significantly increases the efficiency of peptidyl–tRNA hydrolysis by eRF1. This implicates new, additional interactions of full-length eRF3a with the ribosomal preTC. Based on our findings, we suggest that PABP enhances the productive binding of the eRF1–eRF3 complex to the ribosome, via interactions with the N-terminal domain of eRF3a which itself has an active role in translation termination.},

Initiation complex formation on globin mRNA, or on capped viral RNAs such as papaya mosaic virus RNA and tobacco mosaic virus RNA, was strongly stimulated by ATP. In contrast, initiation complex formation on (uncapped) encephalomyocarditis virus RNA was uninfluenced by the presence or absence of ATP, which may be correlated with the recent evidence for scanning-independent internal initiation on this viral RNA. In addition, initiation complex formation on uncapped cowpea mosaic virus RNA and on poly(A,U,G) was only slightly stimulated by ATP, much less than in the case of the capped RNAs. These results suggest that most of the ATP hydrolysed during translation initiation is consumed in cap-dependent processes, probably in unwinding the mRNA, and relatively little in the actual migration or scanning of 40S subunits along the mRNA.},

  abstract = {Translation is a cyclical process in which ribosomal subunits that participate in initiation are derived by recycling of post-termination ribosomal complexes (post-TCs) that have completed the previous round of translation. Post-TCs first dissociate into free 60S subunits and 40S subunits bound to mRNA and with a P-site deacylated tRNA. Release of tRNA and mRNA from recycled 40S subunits requires eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), eIF1 and eIF1A. Deacylated tRNA, which is removed from the P-site of the ribosomal 40S subunit, is replaced by Met-tRNAMeti, which binds as a ternary complex with eIF2-GTP.Initiation on most eukaryotic mRNAs involves scanning by ribosomal 43S preinitiation complexes on the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) from the 5′ cap-proximal point of initial attachment to the initiation codon. The mechanism of scanning is incompletely understood, but requires an 'open' conformation of the 40S subunit, which is induced by eIF1 and eIF1A, is coupled to the activities of the DEAD-box RNA helicase eIF4A, its cofactor eIF4B and eIF4G, and may involve additional DEAD box- or DExH box-containing proteins such as DExH box protein 29 (DHX29; higher eukaryotes) and DEAD box helicase 1 (Ded1; yeast).In a current model for initiation codon recognition, establishment of codon–anticodon base pairing is accompanied by displacement of eIF1 from the P-site, which switches the 40S subunit to a closed conformation that is locked onto mRNA and relieves repression of eIF5-induced hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP and Pi release. eIF5B then mediates the dissociation of eIF2–GDP, eIF1 and eIF1A from the interface surface of the 40S subunit and the joining to it of a 60S ribosomal subunit, to form an 80S ribosome with initiator tRNA in the P-site.Regulation of eIF activity by reversible phosphorylation affects most mRNAs that are translated by the canonical scanning-dependent mode of initiation. The best-characterized examples are phosphorylation of mammalian eIF2 by any of four stress-activated kinases (which leads to a reduction in the level of eIF2–GTP–Met-tRNAMeti ternary complexes) and of mammalian 4E-binding proteins, mainly by mTOR (in response to mitogens and growth factors), which releases eIF4E for assimilation into eIF4F and promotes translation.Sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins have the potential to selectively regulate specific mRNAs or classes of mRNA. 3′ UTR-binding proteins commonly repress translation by forming an inhibitory closed loop with a 5′ cap-binding protein (which may be eIF4E) and an intermediate bridging protein, whereas poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) bound to the 3′ poly(A) tail enhances initiation, possibly by tethering eIF4F so that it is available, despite dissociation from the 5′ cap, to promote further rounds of initiation on the same mRNA without having to be recruited de novo from solution.MicroRNAs have recently emerged as important regulators of translation that also act by binding to the 3′ UTR. The mechanism of repression has not yet been fully elucidated, but appears to have two components, both mediated by the carboxy-terminal domain of the protein GW182: true repression of translation and an accelerated rate of deadenylation-dependent mRNA degradation.},

  abstract = {Plasticity of neoplasia, whereby cancer cells attain stem-cell-like properties, is required for disease progression and represents a major therapeutic challenge. We report that in breast cancer cells NANOG, SNAIL and NODAL transcripts manifest multiple isoforms characterized by different 5’ Untranslated Regions (5’UTRs), whereby translation of a subset of these isoforms is stimulated under hypoxia. The accumulation of the corresponding proteins induces plasticity and “fate-switching” toward stem cell-like phenotypes. Mechanistically, we observe that mTOR inhibitors and chemotherapeutics induce translational activation of a subset of NANOG, SNAIL and NODAL mRNA isoforms akin to hypoxia, engendering stem-cell-like phenotypes. These effects are overcome with drugs that antagonize translational reprogramming caused by eIF2α phosphorylation (e.g. ISRIB), suggesting that the Integrated Stress Response drives breast cancer plasticity. Collectively, our findings reveal a mechanism of induction of plasticity of breast cancer cells and provide a molecular basis for therapeutic strategies aimed at overcoming drug resistance and abrogating metastasis.},

It binds the m7Gppp cap moiety and the adjacent 5'TOP motif of TOP mRNAs, thus impeding the assembly of the eIF4F complex on these transcripts. mTORC1 controls TOP mRNA translation via LARP1, but the details of the mechanism are unclear. Herein we elucidate the mechanism by which mTORC1 controls LARP1's translation repression activity. We demonstrate that mTORC1 phosphorylates LARP1 in vitro and in vivo, activities that are efficiently inhibited by rapamycin and torin1. We uncover 26 rapamycin-sensitive phospho-serine and -threonine residues on LARP1 that are distributed in 7 clusters. Our data show that phosphorylation of a cluster of residues located proximally to the m7Gppp cap-binding DM15 region is particularly sensitive to rapamycin and regulates both the RNA-binding and the translation inhibitory activities of LARP1. Our results unravel a new model of translation control in which the La module (LaMod) and DM15 region of LARP1, both of which can directly interact with TOP mRNA, are differentially regulated: the LaMod remains constitutively bound to PABP (irrespective of the activation status of mTORC1), while the C-terminal DM15 'pendular hook' engages the TOP mRNA 5'-end to repress translation, but only in conditions of mTORC1 inhibition.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The study aims to present the effect of PIK3CA E542K and E545K mutations on glucose metabolism and proliferation and identify their underlying mechanisms in cervical cancer. METHODS: The maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax) of tumors was detected by18F-FDG PET/CT scan. In vitro, glycolysis analysis, extracellular acidification rate analysis, and ATP production were used to evaluate the impact of PIK3CA E542K and E545K mutations on glucose metabolism. The expression level of key glycolytic enzymes was evaluated by western blotting and immunohistochemical staining in cervical cancer cells and tumor tissues, respectively. Immunofluorescence analysis was used to observe the nuclear translocation of β-catenin. The target gene of β-catenin was analyzed by using luciferase reporter system. The glucose metabolic ability of the xenograft models was assessed by SUVmax from microPET/CT scanning. RESULTS: Cervical cancer patients with mutant PIK3CA (E542K and E545K) exhibited a higher SUVmax value than those with wild-type PIK3CA (P~=\,0.037), which was confirmed in xenograft models. In vitro, enhanced glucose metabolism and proliferation was observed in SiHa and MS751 cells with mutant PIK3CA. The mRNA and protein expression of key glycolytic enzymes was increased. AKT/GSK3β/β-catenin signaling was highly activated in SiHa and MS751 cells with mutant PIK3CA. Knocking down β-catenin expression decreased glucose uptake and lactate production. In addition, the nuclear accumulation of β-catenin was found in SiHa cells and tumors with mutant PIK3CA. Furthermore, β-catenin downregulated the expression of SIRT3 via suppressing the activity of the SIRT3 promotor, and the reduced glucose uptake and lactate production due to the downregulation of β-catenin can be reversed by the transfection of SIRT3 siRNA in SiHa cells with mutant PIK3CA. The negative correlation between β-catenin and SIRT3 was further confirmed in cervical cancer tissues. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide evidence that the PI3K E542K and E545K/β-catenin/SIRT3 signaling axis regulates glucose metabolism and proliferation in cervical cancers with PIK3CA mutations, suggesting therapeutic targets in the treatment of cervical cancers.

Additionally, poor-prognosis basal-like and luminal B tumors are further subdivided by immune component infiltration, suggesting the current classification is incomplete. Proteome-based networks distinguish functional protein modules for breast tumor groups, with co-expression of EGFR and MET marking ductal carcinoma in situ regions of normal-like tumors and lending to a more accurate classification of this poorly defined subtype. Genes included within prognostic mRNA panels have significantly higher than average mRNA-protein correlations, and gene copy number alterations are dampened at the protein-level; underscoring the value of proteome quantification for prognostication and phenotypic classification.

The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ( {$>$} 25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

The Treg cell lineage-specification factor FOXP3 (forkhead box P3) is essential for Treg cells’ ability to uphold immunologic tolerance. In humans, FOXP3 exists in several different isoforms, however, their specific role is poorly understood.Objective:To define the regulation and functions of the 2 major FOXP3 isoforms, FOXP3fl and FOXP3Δ2, as well as to establish whether their expression is associated with the ischemic atherosclerotic disease.Methods and Results:Human primary T cells were transduced with lentiviruses encoding distinct FOXP3 isoforms. The phenotype and function of these cells were analyzed by flow cytometry, in vitro suppression assays and RNA-sequencing. We also assessed the effect of activation on Treg cells isolated from healthy volunteers. Treg cell activation resulted in increased FOXP3 expression that predominantly was made up of FOXP3Δ2. FOXP3Δ2 induced specific transcription of GARP (glycoprotein A repetitions predominant), which functions by tethering the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF (transforming growth factor)-β to the cell membrane of activated Treg cells. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine the impact of alternative splicing of FOXP3 in relation with atherosclerotic plaque stability in a cohort of {$>$}150 patients that underwent carotid endarterectomy. Plaque instability was associated with a lower FOXP3Δ2 transcript usage, when comparing plaques from patients without symptoms and patients with the occurrence of recent ({$<$}1 month) vascular symptoms including minor stroke, transient ischemic attack, or amaurosis fugax. No difference was detected in total levels of FOXP3 mRNA between these 2 groups.Conclusions:These results suggest that activated Treg cells suppress the atherosclerotic disease process and that FOXP3Δ2 controls a transcriptional program that acts protectively in human atherosclerotic plaques.},

In this pathway, mRNAs are first deadenylated, then decapped and finally degraded from the 5′ end.The GW182 proteins play a central part in silencing. They bridge the interaction between Argonaute proteins and downstream effector complexes, such as the cytoplasmic deadenylase complexes PAN2–PAN3 and CCR4–NOT.Structural studies have revealed that GW182 proteins interact with their partners by inserting tryptophan residues into hydrophobic pockets exposed on the surface of Argonaute proteins, PAN3 and NOT9.Current models for miRNA-mediated translational repression invoke displacement of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4A1 (eIF4A1) or its paralogue eIF4A2, or the recruitment of the translational repressor and decapping activator DEAD box protein 6 (DDX6).Remaining open questions include how miRNA-induced silencing complexes (miRISCs) displace eIF4A1 and eIF4A2, and how DDX6 represses translation.},

  abstract = {There are currently few therapeutic options for patients with pancreatic cancer, and new insights into the pathogenesis of this lethal disease are urgently needed. Toward this end, we performed a comprehensive genetic analysis of 24 pancreatic cancers. We first determined the sequences of 23,219 transcripts, representing 20,661 protein-coding genes, in these samples. Then, we searched for homozygous deletions and amplifications in the tumor DNA by using microarrays containing probes for ∼106 single-nucleotide polymorphisms. We found that pancreatic cancers contain an average of 63 genetic alterations, the majority of which are point mutations. These alterations defined a core set of 12 cellular signaling pathways and processes that were each genetically altered in 67 to 100\% of the tumors. Analysis of these tumors' transcriptomes with next-generation sequencing-by-synthesis technologies provided independent evidence for the importance of these pathways and processes. Our data indicate that genetically altered core pathways and regulatory processes only become evident once the coding regions of the genome are analyzed in depth. Dysregulation of these core pathways and processes through mutation can explain the major features of pancreatic tumorigenesis. Sequencing of DNA mutations shows that the same 12 signaling pathways are disrupted in most pancreatic tumors, suggesting these as key to tumor development.

  abstract = {How the immune system readies for battle Although gene expression is tightly controlled at both the RNA and protein levels, the quantitative contribution of each step, especially during dynamic responses, remains largely unknown. Indeed, there has been much debate whether changes in RNA level contribute substantially to protein-level regulation. Jovanovic et al. built a genome-scale model of the temporal dynamics of differential protein expression during the stimulation of immunological dendritic cells (see the Perspective by Li and Biggin). Newly stimulated functions involved the up-regulation of specific RNAs and concomitant increases in the levels of the proteins they encode, whereas housekeeping functions were regulated posttranscriptionally at the protein level. Science, this issue 10.1126/science.1259038; see also p. 1066 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONMammalian gene expression is tightly controlled through the interplay between the RNA and protein life cycles. Although studies of individual genes have shown that regulation of each of these processes is important for correct protein expression, the quantitative contribution of each step to changes in protein expression levels remains largely unknown and much debated. Many studies have attempted to address this question in the context of steady-state protein levels, and comparing steady-state RNA and protein abundances has indicated a considerable discrepancy between RNA and protein levels. In contrast, only a few studies have attempted to shed light on how changes in each of these processes determine differential protein expression—either relative (ratios) or absolute (differences)—during dynamic responses, and only one recent report has attempted to quantitate each process. Understanding these contributions to a dynamic response on a systems scale is essential both for deciphering how cells deploy regulatory processes to accomplish physiological changes and for discovering key molecular regulators controlling each process. RATIONALEWe developed an integrated experimental and computational strategy to quantitatively assess how protein levels are maintained in the context of a dynamic response and applied it to the model response of mouse immune bone marrow–derived dendritic cells (DCs) to stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We used a modified pulsed-SILAC (stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture) approach to track newly synthesized and previously labeled proteins over the first 12 hours of the response. In addition, we independently measured replicate RNA-sequencing profiles under the same conditions. We devised a computational strategy to infer per-mRNA translation rates and protein degradation rates at each time point from the temporal transcriptional profiles and pulsed-SILAC proteomics data. This allowed us to build a genome-scale quantitative model of the temporal dynamics of differential protein expression in DCs responding to LPS. RESULTSWe found that before stimulation, mRNA levels contribute to overall protein expression levels more than double the combined contribution of protein translation and degradation rates. Upon LPS stimulation, changes in mRNA abundance play an even more dominant role in dynamic changes in protein levels, especially in immune response genes. Nevertheless, several protein modules—especially the preexisting proteome of proteins performing basic cellular functions—are predominantly regulated in stimulated cells at the level of protein translation or degradation, accounting for over half of the absolute change in protein molecules in the cell. In particular, despite the repression of their transcripts, the level of many proteins in the translational machinery is up-regulated upon LPS stimulation because of significantly increased translation rates, and elevated protein degradation of mitochondrial proteins plays a central role in remodeling cellular energy metabolism. CONCLUSIONSOur results support a model in which the induction of novel cellular functions is primarily driven through transcriptional changes, whereas regulation of protein production or degradation updates the levels of preexisting functions as required for an activated state. Our approach for building quantitative genome-scale models of the temporal dynamics of protein expression is broadly applicable to other dynamic systems. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/347/6226/1259038/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Dynamic protein expression regulation in dendritic cells upon stimulation with LPS.We developed an integrated experimental and computational strategy to quantitatively assess how protein levels are maintained in the context of a dynamic response. Our results support a model in which the induction of novel cellular functions is primarily driven through transcriptional changes, whereas regulation of protein production or degradation updates the levels of preexisting functions. Protein expression is regulated by the production and degradation of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and proteins, but their specific relationships remain unknown. We combine measurements of protein production and degradation and mRNA dynamics so as to build a quantitative genomic model of the differential regulation of gene expression in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated mouse dendritic cells. Changes in mRNA abundance play a dominant role in determining most dynamic fold changes in protein levels. Conversely, the preexisting proteome of proteins performing basic cellular functions is remodeled primarily through changes in protein production or degradation, accounting for more than half of the absolute change in protein molecules in the cell. Thus, the proteome is regulated by transcriptional induction for newly activated cellular functions and by protein life-cycle changes for remodeling of preexisting functions. Levels of “housekeeping” proteins are maintained directly, but those of immune response proteins depend on more transcription.

  abstract = {Cell type–specific quantitative trait loci Understanding how human genetic variation affects phenotype requires tissue- or even cell type–specific measurements. Kim-Hellmuth et al. used computational methods to identify cell-type proportions within bulk tissues in the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project dataset to identify cell-type interaction quantitative trait loci and map these to genetic variants correlated with expression or splicing differences between individuals. By characterizing the cellular context, this study illustrates how genetic variants that operate in a cell type–specific manner affect gene regulation and can be linked to complex traits. This deconvolution and analysis of cell types from bulk tissues allows greater precision in understanding how phenotypes are linked to genetic variation. Science, this issue p. eaaz8528 Structured Abstract INTRODUCTIONEfforts to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) across human tissues by the GTEx Consortium and others have identified expression and splicing QTLs (eQTLs and sQTLs, respectively) for a majority of genes. However, these studies were largely performed with gene expression measurements from bulk tissue samples, thus obscuring the cellular specificity of genetic regulatory effects and in turn limiting their functional interpretation. Identifying the cell type (or types) in which a QTL is active will be key to uncovering the molecular mechanisms that underlie complex trait variation. Recent studies demonstrated the feasibility of identifying cell type–specific QTLs from bulk tissue RNA-sequencing data by using computational estimates of cell type proportions. To date, such approaches have only been applied to a limited number of cell types and tissues. By applying this methodology to GTEx tissues for a diverse set of cell types, we aim to characterize the cellular specificity of genetic effects across human tissues and to describe the contribution of these effects to complex traits. RATIONALEA growing number of in silico cell type deconvolution methods and associated reference panels with cell type–specific marker genes enable the robust estimation of the enrichment of specific cell types from bulk tissue gene expression data. We benchmarked and used enrichment estimates for seven cell types (adipocytes, epithelial cells, hepatocytes, keratinocytes, myocytes, neurons, and neutrophils) across 35 tissues from the GTEx project to map QTLs that are specific to at least one cell type. We mapped such cell type–interaction QTLs for expression and splicing (ieQTLs and isQTLs, respectively) by testing for interactions between genotype and cell type enrichment. RESULTSUsing 43 pairs of tissues and cell types, we found 3347 protein-coding and long intergenic noncoding RNA (lincRNA) genes with an ieQTL and 987 genes with an isQTL (at 5\% false discovery rate in each pair). To validate these findings, we tested the QTLs for replication in available external datasets and applied an independent validation using allele-specific expression from eQTL heterozygotes. We analyzed the cell type–interaction QTLs for patterns of tissue sharing and found that ieQTLs are enriched for genes with tissue-specific eQTLs and are generally not shared across unrelated tissues, suggesting that tissue-specific eQTLs originate in tissue-specific cell types. Last, we tested the ieQTLs and isQTLs for colocalization with genetic associations for 87 complex traits. We show that cell type–interaction QTLs are enriched for complex trait associations and identify colocalizations for hundreds of loci that were undetected in bulk tissue, corresponding to an increase of {$>$}50\% over colocalizations with standard QTLs. Our results also reveal the cellular specificity and potential origin for a similar number of colocalized standard QTLs. CONCLUSIONThe ieQTLs and isQTLs identified for seven cell types across GTEx tissues suggest that the large majority of cell type–specific QTLs remains to be discovered. Our colocalization results indicate that comprehensive mapping of cell type–specific QTLs will be highly valuable for gaining a mechanistic understanding of complex trait associations. We anticipate that the approaches presented here will complement studies mapping QTLs in single cells. {$<$}img class="fragment-image" aria-describedby="F1-caption" src="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/369/6509/eaaz8528/F1.medium.gif"/{$>$} Download high-res image Open in new tab Download Powerpoint Detection of cell type–specific effects on gene expression.The enrichment of seven cell types is calculated across GTEx tissues, enabling mapping of cell type–interaction QTLs for expression and splicing by testing for significant interactions between genotypes and cell type enrichments. Linking these QTLs to complex trait associations enables discovery of {$>$}50\% more colocalizations compared with standard QTLs and reveals the cellular specificity of traits. The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project has identified expression and splicing quantitative trait loci in cis (QTLs) for the majority of genes across a wide range of human tissues. However, the functional characterization of these QTLs has been limited by the heterogeneous cellular composition of GTEx tissue samples. We mapped interactions between computational estimates of cell type abundance and genotype to identify cell type–interaction QTLs for seven cell types and show that cell type–interaction expression QTLs (eQTLs) provide finer resolution to tissue specificity than bulk tissue cis-eQTLs. Analyses of genetic associations with 87 complex traits show a contribution from cell type–interaction QTLs and enables the discovery of hundreds of previously unidentified colocalized loci that are masked in bulk tissue.

The binding of AMP to AMPK allows it to be phosphorylated by upstream kinases, resulting in its activation. In contrast, the binding of ATP prevents its activation. AMPK regulates a multitude of metabolic processes that cumulatively function to maintain cellular energy homeostasis through repression of a number of energy-consuming processes with simultaneous enhancement of energy-producing processes. One downstream AMPK target that has been recently identified is the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a positive effector of cell growth and division.

  abstract = {Traditionally, the different stages of gene expression were considered to be separate processes that operated independently. Biochemical and genetic studies have instead revealed high levels of coupling between the different stages. In recent years, genome-wide and systems-level analyses have greatly extended our understanding of coupling in gene expression, by both revealing the effect that certain forms of coupling have on a more global scale, and unveiling novel forms of coupling that had not been identified using more traditional techniques.Genomic analyses of the binding of transcription factors and chromatin remodellers with DNA have revealed extensive coordination and coupling between these factors, forming regulatory networks that control how many genes are expressed.Genome-wide analysis of associations between the nuclear pore and nuclear lamina revealed extensive coupling between the transcription level of a given gene and its nuclear localization. In particular, different subcomplexes within the nuclear pore associate with specific types of genetic loci.Genomic analyses of mRNA processing have shown that splicing commitment occurs co-transcriptionally, but that in yeast the splicing completes post-transcriptionally, and that the spliceosome can regulate expression of specific types of mRNAs by increasing or decreasing their splicing efficiencies.Microarray analyses have also shown that the co-transcriptional recruitment of mRNA export factors results in functional specificities, in which different factors transport specific types of mRNAs; the combination of whole-genome screens and array analyses also demonstrated an important role for the exosome in mRNA export.Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with microarray (ChIP–chip) analyses in higher eukaryotes provide support for a dynamic messenger ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) model, in which the composition of the mRNP associated with the nascent transcript changes along the length of the transcript.Whole-genome analysis of the associations between proteasomal components and chromatin revealed a widespread role for the proteasome in transcriptional activation and enrichment of binding of the proteasome at ribosomal protein genes. This coupling between the protein synthesis and degradation machineries could allow feedback that globally reduces expression levels when the proteasome is compromised.Network analysis of the genomic associations of many factors involved in gene expression revealed novel connections between the different levels of gene expression. In particular, factors involved in nuclear transport, general transcription factors, RNA-processing factors and nucleosome remodellers were found to exhibit highly similar binding profiles and to have a large number of neighbours, allowing them to exert global influences on many genes at once.},

  abstract = {Recombinant plasmids that direct synthesis of rat preproinsulin under the direction of the SV40 early promoter have been used to probe the mechanism of initiation of translation. Insertion of an upstream AUG triplet that was out-of-frame with respect to the coding sequence for preproinsulin red iced the yield of proinsulin, in keeping with the predictions of the scanning model. The extent to which an upstream AUG codon interfered depended on sequences surrounding the AUG triplet; with two constructs (p255/20 and C2) the 5′-proximal AUG codon constituted an absolute barrier: there was no initiation at the downstream start site for preproinsulin. With two other constructs (p255/9, p255/21), however, proinsulin was made despite the presence of an upstream, out-of-frame AUG codon in a favorable context for initiation. In those cases the reading frame set by the first AUG triplet was short, terminating before the start of the preproinsulin coding sequence. The interpretation that ribosomes initiate at the first AUG, terminate, and then reinitiate at the AUG that directly precedes the preproinsulin coding sequence was tested by introducing a point mutation that eliminated the terminator codon: the resulting mutant made no proinsulin.},

  abstract = {Tumor initiation in the intestine can rapidly occur from Lgr5(+) crypt columnar stem cells. Dclk1 is a marker of differentiated Tuft cells and, when coexpressed with Lgr5, also marks intestinal cancer stem cells. Here, we show that Elp3, the catalytic subunit of the Elongator complex, is required for Wnt-driven intestinal tumor initiation and radiation-induced regeneration by maintaining a subpool of Lgr5(+)/Dclk1(+)/Sox9(+) cells. Elp3 deficiency dramatically delayed tumor appearance in Apc-mutated intestinal epithelia and greatly prolonged mice survival without affecting the normal epithelium. Specific ablation of Elp3 in Lgr5(+) cells resulted in marked reduction of polyp formation upon Apc inactivation, in part due to a decreased number of Lgr5(+)/Dclk1(+)/Sox9(+) cells. Mechanistically, Elp3 is induced by Wnt signaling and promotes Sox9 translation, which is needed to maintain the subpool of Lgr5(+)/Dclk1(+) cancer stem cells. Consequently, Elp3 or Sox9 depletion led to similar defects in Dclk1(+) cancer stem cells in ex vivo organoids. Finally, Elp3 deficiency strongly impaired radiation-induced intestinal regeneration, in part because of decreased Sox9 protein levels. Together, our data demonstrate the crucial role of Elp3 in maintaining a subpopulation of Lgr5-derived and Sox9-expressing cells needed to trigger Wnt-driven tumor initiation in the intestine.},

Remarkably, these evolutionary changes are~compensated post-transcriptionally to maintain preferred stoichiometry of protein synthesis rates.~Even more strikingly, in eukaryotic budding yeast,~functionally analogous proteins that arose independently from bacterial counterparts also evolved to convergent in-pathway expression. The broad requirement for exact protein stoichiometries despite regulatory divergence provides an unexpected principle for building biological pathways both in nature and for synthetic activities.},

  abstract = {During translation elongation, the ribosome ratchets along its mRNA template, incorporating each new amino acid and translocating from one codon to the next. The elongation cycle requires dramatic structural rearrangements of the ribosome. We show here that deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments reveals not only the position of each ribosome but also, unexpectedly, its particular stage of the elongation cycle. Sequencing reveals two distinct populations of ribosome footprints, 28–30 nucleotides and 20–22 nucleotides long, representing translating ribosomes in distinct states, differentially stabilized by specific elongation inhibitors. We find that the balance of small and large footprints varies by codon and is correlated with translation speed. The ability to visualize conformational changes in the ribosome during elongation, at single-codon resolution, provides a new way to study the detailed kinetics of translation and a new probe with which to identify the factors that affect each step in the elongation cycle.},

  abstract = {Regulation of gene expression through translational control is a fundamental mechanism implicated in many biological processes ranging from memory formation to innate immunity and whose dysregulation contributes to human diseases. Genome wide analyses of translational control strive to identify differential translation independent of cytosolic mRNA levels. For this reason, most studies measure genes’ translation levels as log ratios (translation levels divided by corresponding cytosolic mRNA levels obtained in parallel). Counterintuitively, arising from a mathematical necessity, these log ratios tend to be highly correlated with the cytosolic mRNA levels. Accordingly, they do not effectively correct for cytosolic mRNA level and generate substantial numbers of biological false positives and false negatives. We show that analysis of partial variance, which produces estimates of translational activity that are independent of cytosolic mRNA levels, is a superior alternative. When combined with a variance shrinkage method for estimating error variance, analysis of partial variance has the additional benefit of having greater statistical power and identifying fewer genes as translationally regulated resulting merely from unrealistically low variance estimates rather than from large changes in translational activity. In contrast to log ratios, this formal analytical approach estimates translation effects in a statistically rigorous manner, eliminates the need for inefficient and error-prone heuristics, and produces results that agree with biological function. The method is applicable to datasets obtained from both the commonly used polysome microarray method and the sequencing-based ribosome profiling method.},

When studying differential translation, levels of both actively translating mRNAs and total cytosolic mRNAs are obtained where the latter is used to correct for a possible contribution of differential cytosolic mRNA levels to the observed differential levels of actively translated mRNAs. We have recently shown that analysis of partial variance (APV) corrects for cytosolic mRNA levels more effectively than the commonly applied log ratio approach. APV provides a high degree of specificity and sensitivity for detecting biologically meaningful translation changes, especially when combined with a variance shrinkage method for estimating random error. Here we describe the anota (analysis of translational activity) R-package which implements APV, allows scrutiny of associated statistical assumptions and provides biologically motivated filters for analysis of genome wide datasets. Although the package was developed for analysis of differential translation in polysome microarray or ribosome-profiling datasets, any high-dimensional data that result in paired controls, such as RNP immunoprecipitation-microarray (RIP-CHIP) datasets, can be successfully analyzed with anota.

We provide a unique genome-wide analysis of translational targets of canonical mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin and PP242) compared with metformin, revealing that metformin controls gene expression at the level of mRNA translation to an extent comparable to that of canonical mTOR inhibitors. Importantly, metformin's antiproliferative activity can be explained by selective translational suppression of mRNAs encoding cell-cycle regulators via the mTORC1/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein pathway. Thus, metformin selectively inhibits translation of mRNAs encoding proteins that promote neoplastic proliferation, which should facilitate studies on metformin and related biguanides in cancer prevention and treatment.},

While extensive post-transcriptional, translational and protein degradation control clearly influence protein concentration and functionality, it is often thought that protein abundances are primarily determined by the abundances of the corresponding mRNAs. Hence surprisingly, a recent study showed that abundances of orthologous nematode and fly proteins correlate better than their corresponding mRNA abundances. We tested if this phenomenon is general by collecting and testing matching large-scale protein and mRNA expression data sets from seven different species: two bacteria, yeast, nematode, fly, human, and rice. We find that steady-state abundances of proteins show significantly higher correlation across these diverse phylogenetic taxa than the abundances of their corresponding mRNAs (p=0.0008, paired Wilcoxon). These data support the presence of strong selective pressure to maintain protein abundances during evolution, even when mRNA abundances diverge.},

The voom method estimates the mean-variance relationship of the log-counts, generates a precision weight for each observation and enters these into the limma empirical Bayes analysis pipeline.

Simulation studies show that voom performs as well or better than count-based RNA-seq methods even when the data are generated according to the assumptions of the earlier methods.

  abstract = {A recent report revealed that phosphoinositide-3-kinase, catalytic, alpha (PIK3CA) gene is somatically mutated in several types of human cancer, suggesting the mutated PIK3CA gene as an oncogene in human cancers. However, because the previous report focused the mutational search primarily on colon cancers, the data on PIK3CA mutations in other types of human cancers have been largely unknown. Here, we performed mutational analysis of the PIK3CA gene by polymerase chain reaction-single-strand conformation polymorphism assay in 668 cases of common human cancers, including hepatocellular carcinomas, acute leukemias, gastric carcinomas, breast carcinomas, and non-small-cell lung cancers. We detected PIK3CA somatic mutations in 26 of 73 hepatocellular carcinomas (35.6\%), 25 of 93 breast carcinomas (26.9\%), 12 of 185 gastric carcinomas (6.5\%), one of 88 acute leukemias (1.1\%), and three of 229 non-small-cell lung cancers (1.3\%). Some of the PIK3CA mutations were detected in the early lesions of breast cancer carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and gastric carcinomas, suggesting that PIK3CA mutation may occur independent of stage of the tumors. The high incidence and wide distribution of PIK3CA gene mutation in the common human cancers suggest that alterations of lipid kinase pathway by PIK3CA mutations contribute to the development of human cancers.},

The 13-subunit, 800-kilodalton eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) organizes initiation factor and ribosome interactions required for productive translation. However, current understanding of eIF3 function does not explain genetic evidence correlating eIF3 deregulation with tissue-specific cancers and developmental defects. Here we report the genome-wide discovery of human transcripts that interact with eIF3 using photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP). eIF3 binds to a highly specific program of messenger RNAs involved in cell growth control processes, including cell cycling, differentiation and apoptosis, via the mRNA 5' untranslated region. Surprisingly, functional analysis of the interaction between eIF3 and two mRNAs encoding the cell proliferation regulators c-JUN and BTG1 reveals that eIF3 uses different modes of RNA stem-loop binding to exert either translational activation or repression. Our findings illuminate a new role for eIF3 in governing a specialized repertoire of gene expression and suggest that binding of eIF3 to specific mRNAs could be targeted to control carcinogenesis.},

  abstract = {Purpose of Review Obesity is a recognized risk factor for the development of breast cancer and recurrence even when patients are treated appropriately. We reviewed the literature that addresses the impact of obesity on diagnosis and the individual therapeutic interventions, and present a summary of the findings. Recent Findings Compared to non-obese women with breast cancer, obese women with breast cancer have a worse disease-free and overall survival despite appropriate local and systemic therapies. In brief, obese breast cancer patients experience more complications related to surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Further, obese patients are at increased risk for local recurrence compared to normal-weight women. Similarly, systemic chemotherapy is less effective, even when dosed appropriately on the basis of actual weight. Overall, endocrine therapy is less effective in obese women, and there is a suggestion that aromatase inhibitors may be selectively less effective than tamoxifen. Obese women are less likely to undergo breast reconstruction than normal-weight women, and those who do have surgery experience more surgical complications. Summary The efficacy of cancer treatments is significantly lower in obese breast cancer survivors, posing greater challenges in patient care and disease management in this patient population. Further investigations are warranted to assess the effects on treatment outcomes and optimize therapeutic mechanisms in order to successfully target breast cancer associated with obesity.},

These sources of noise must be modeled and removed to accurately measure biological variability and to obtain correct statistical inference when performing high-throughput genomic analysis. We introduced surrogate variable analysis (sva) for estimating these artifacts by (i) identifying the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts and (ii) estimating the artifacts with principal components or singular vectors of the subset of the data matrix. The resulting estimates of artifacts can be used in subsequent analyses as adjustment factors to correct analyses. Here I describe a version of the sva approach specifically created for count data or FPKMs from sequencing experiments based on appropriate data transformation. I also describe the addition of supervised sva (ssva) for using control probes to identify the part of the genomic data only affected by artifacts. I present a comparison between these versions of sva and other methods for batch effect estimation on simulated data, real count-based data and FPKM-based data. These updates are available through the sva Bioconductor package and I have made fully reproducible analysis using these methods available from: https://github.com/jtleek/svaseq.},

Considering that mRNA translation is an energy demanding process, cancer cells must produce sufficient ATP to meet energy demand of hyperactive translational machinery. In recent years, the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) emerged as a central regulatory node which coordinates energy consumption by the translation apparatus and ATP production in mitochondria. Aberrant mTOR signaling underpins the vast majority of cancers whereby increased mTOR activity is thought to be a major determinant of both malignant translatomes and metabolomes. Nonetheless, the role of mTOR and other related signaling nodes (e.g. AMPK) in orchestrating protein synthesis and cancer energetics is only recently being unraveled. In this review, we discuss recent findings that provide insights into the molecular underpinnings of coordination of translational and metabolic programs of cancer cells, and potential strategies to translate these findings into clinical treatments.},

  abstract = {The kinase PKR is a central component of the interferon antiviral pathway. PKR is activated upon binding double-stranded (ds) RNA to undergo autophosphorylation. Although PKR is known to dimerize, the relationship between dimerization and activation remains unclear. Here, we directly characterize dimerization of PKR in free solution using analytical ultracentrifugation and correlate self-association with autophosphorylation activity. Latent, unphosphorylated PKR exists predominantly as a monomer at protein concentrations below 2 mg/ml. A monomer sedimentation coefficient of s(20,w)(0)=3.58 S and a frictional ratio of f/f(0)=1.62 indicate an asymmetric shape. Sedimentation equilibrium measurements indicate that PKR undergoes a weak, reversible monomer-dimer equilibrium with K(d)=450 microM. This dimerization reaction serves to initiate a previously unrecognized dsRNA-independent autophosphorylation reaction. The resulting activated enzyme is phosphorylated on the two critical threonine residues present in the activation loop and is competent to phosphorylate the physiological substrate, eIF2alpha. Dimer stability is enhanced by approximately 500-fold upon autophosphorylation. We propose a chain reaction model for PKR dsRNA-independent activation where dimerization of latent enzyme followed by intermolecular phosphorylation serves as the initiation step. Subsequent propagation steps likely involve phosphorylation of latent PKR monomers by activated enzyme within high-affinity heterodimers. Our results support a model whereby dsRNA functions by bringing PKR monomers into close proximity in a manner that is analogous to the dimerization of free PKR.},

  abstract = {PKR (protein kinase R) is a central component of the interferon antiviral defense pathway. Upon binding dsRNA, PKR undergoes autophosphorylation reactions that activate the kinase. PKR then phosphorylates eIF2α, thus inhibiting protein synthesis in virally-infected cells. Here, we define the mechanism of PKR activation using a series dsRNAs of increasing length. A minimal dsRNA of 30 bp is required to bind two PKR monomers and 30 bp is the smallest dsRNA that elicits autophosphorylation activity. Thus, the ability of dsRNAs to function as PKR activators is correlated with binding of two or more PKR monomers. Sedimentation velocity data fit a model where PKR monomers sequentially attach to a single dsRNA. These results support an activation mechanism where the role of the dsRNA is to bring two or more PKR monomers in close proximity to enhance dimerization via the kinase domain. This model explains the inhibition observed at high dsRNA concentrations and the strong dependence of maximum activation on dsRNA binding affinity. Binding affinities increase dramatically upon reducing the salt concentration from 200 to 75 mM NaCl and we observe that a second PKR can bind to the 20 bp dsRNA. Nonspecific assembly of PKR on dsRNA occurs stochastically without apparent cooperativity.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Activation of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway, resulting in increased cell proliferation, survival, and motility, is believed to play an oncogenic role in many cancer types. The PIK3CA gene encodes the p110alpha catalytic subunit of PI3K, and is amplified in some ovarian cancers, whereas the AKT2 gene is amplified in some ovarian, breast, and pancreatic cancers. Recently, in a mutational screen of eight PI3K genes and eight PI3K-like genes, PIK3CA was found to be the only gene affected by somatic mutations, which were observed frequently in gastrointestinal and brain cancers. Here, we test whether PIK3CA is subject to mutation in ovarian and breast cancers. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Exons 9 and 20, encoding the highly conserved helical and kinase domains of PIK3CA, were subjected to sequence analysis in 198 advanced stage epithelial ovarian carcinomas and 72 invasive breast carcinomas (48 of ductal histology and 24 of lobular histology). RESULTS: Somatic missense mutations were observed in 24 of 198 (12\%) ovarian carcinomas, and in 13 of 72 (18\%) breast carcinomas. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that mutations of PIK3CA play an oncogenic role in substantial fractions of ovarian and breast carcinomas, and in consideration of mutation of other components of the PI3K-AKT pathway in both tumor types, confirm the major oncogenic role of this pathway in ovarian and breast carcinomas.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study is to determine if high eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) overexpression (sevenfold elevation or more over benign breast tissue) is associated with a worse clinical outcome. SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Dysregulation of cellular functions by selective overexpression of specific proteins can lead to malignant transformation. The overexpression of eIF4E preferentially increases translation of mRNAs with long, G-C rich 5'-untranslated regions. Selective gene products, such as tumor neoangiogenic factors, ornithine decarboxylase, and cyclin D1, are upregulated. METHODS: One hundred fourteen breast specimens were analyzed and eIF4E overexpression was quantified by Western blot analysis. Quantification for eIF4E protein level was accomplished using a rabbit anti-eIF4E antibody and colorimetric development of Western blots using nitro blue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate. The blots were scanned and analyzed by densitometry. Treatment, pathologic, and clinical outcome data variables were analyzed. Statistical analysis was performed to determine if eIF4E overexpression is associated with breast cancer clinical outcome. RESULTS: In the 55 benign specimens, the mean eIF4E expression was 1.1+/-0.4 fold (mean +/- standard deviation). All 59 malignant breast carcinoma specimens were noted to have eIF4E overexpression (range, 1.9-fold to 30.6-fold), with a mean overexpression of 10.8+/-6.3-fold. The mean level of eIF4E expression in malignant specimens was higher than benign specimens (p {$<$} 0.05, unpaired t test). The degree of eIF4E overexpression appears to be independent of T and N stage. In the 21 patients with eIF4E overexpression of less than sevenfold, there was one cancer recurrence but no cancer-related deaths. In the 38 patients with high eIF4E overexpression (sevenfold or more), 14 patients had breast cancer recurrences (p = 0.03, log rank test), of whom 11 have died from the disease (p = 0.04, log rank test). The average follow-up interval in this study was 40 months. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with stage I to III breast cancer and high eIF4E overexpression had a higher rate of cancer recurrence and a higher rate of cancer-related death when compared to similar-stage breast cancer patients with low eIF4E overexpression. Therefore, eIF4E protein overexpression may be of prognostic value in stage I to III breast carcinoma.},

Here, we present a genome-wide approach, based on ribosome profiling, for measuring absolute protein synthesis rates. The resultant E. coli data set transforms our understanding of the extent to which protein synthesis is precisely controlled to optimize function and efficiency. Members of multiprotein complexes are made in precise proportion to their stoichiometry, whereas components of functional modules are produced differentially according to their hierarchical role. Estimates of absolute protein abundance also reveal principles for optimizing design. These include how the level of different types of transcription factors is optimized for rapid response and how a metabolic pathway (methionine biosynthesis) balances production cost with activity requirements. Our studies reveal how general principles, important both for understanding natural systems and for synthesizing new ones, emerge from quantitative analyses of protein synthesis.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Global analysis of translation regulation has recently been enabled by the development of Ribosome Profiling, or Ribo-seq, technology. This approach provides maps of ribosome activity for each expressed gene in a given biological sample. Measurements of translation efficiency are generated when Ribo-seq data is analyzed in combination with matched RNA-seq gene expression profiles. Existing computational methods for identifying genes with differential translation across samples are based on sound principles, but require users to choose between accuracy and speed. Results: We present Riborex, a computational tool for mapping genome-wide differences in translation efficiency. Riborex shares a similar mathematical structure with existing methods, but has a simplified implementation. Riborex directly leverages established RNA-seq analysis frameworks for all parameter estimation, providing users with a choice among robust engines for these computations. The result is a method that is dramatically faster than available methods without sacrificing accuracy. Availability and Implementation: https://github.com/smithlabcode/riborex.

This property makes polysome-profiling inconvenient for larger experimental designs or samples with low RNA amounts. To address this, we optimized a non-linear sucrose gradient which reproducibly enriches for efficiently translated mRNA in only one or two fractions, thereby reducing sample handling 5-10-fold. The technique generates polysome-associated RNA with a quality reflecting the starting material and, when coupled with smart-seq2 single-cell RNA sequencing, translatomes in small tissues from biobanks can be obtained. Translatomes acquired using optimized non-linear gradients resemble those obtained with the standard approach employing linear gradients. Polysome-profiling using optimized non-linear gradients in serum starved HCT-116 cells with or without p53 showed that p53 status associates with changes in mRNA abundance and translational efficiency leading to changes in protein levels. Moreover, p53 status also induced translational buffering whereby changes in mRNA levels are buffered at the level of mRNA translation. Thus, here we present a polysome-profiling technique applicable to large study designs, primary cells and frozen tissue samples such as those collected in biobanks.},

Here, we review the relationship between protein and mRNA levels under various scenarios, such as steady state, long-term state changes, and short-term adaptation, demonstrating the complexity of gene expression regulation, especially during dynamic transitions. The spatial and temporal variations of mRNAs, as well as the local availability of resources for protein biosynthesis, strongly influence the relationship between protein levels and their coding transcripts. We further discuss the buffering of mRNA fluctuations at the level of protein concentrations. We conclude that transcript levels by themselves are not sufficient to predict protein levels in many scenarios and to thus explain genotype-phenotype relationships and that high-quality data quantifying different levels of gene expression are indispensable for the complete understanding of biological processes.},

However, mTOR-sensitive translatomes commonly include mRNAs with a 5’ terminal oligopyrimidine tract (TOP), such as those encoding ribosomal proteins, but not ISGs. Because these translatomes were obtained under conditions when ISG expression is not induced, we examined the mTOR-sensitive translatome in human WISH cells stimulated with IFN β. The mTOR inhibitor Torin1 resulted in a repression of global protein synthesis, including that of ISG products, and translation of all but 3 ISG mRNAs (TLR3, NT5C3A, and RNF19B) was not selectively more sensitive to mTOR inhibition. Detailed studies of NT5C3A revealed an IFN-induced change in transcription start site resulting in a switch from a non-TOP to a TOP-like transcript variant and mTOR sensitive translation. Thus, we show that, in the cell model used, translation of the vast majority of ISG mRNAs is not selectively sensitive to mTOR activity and describe an uncharacterized mechanism wherein the 5’-UTR of an mRNA is altered in response to a cytokine, resulting in a shift from mTOR-insensitive to mTOR-sensitive translation.},

Subcutaneous injection of HuR-overexpressing RKO cells into nude mice produced significantly larger tumors than those arising from control populations; conversely, RKO cells expressing reduced HuR through small interference RNA- or antisense HuR-based approaches developed significantly more slowly.

  abstract = {Abstract Estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) activity is associated with increased cancer cell proliferation. Studies aiming to understand the impact of ERα on cancer-associated phenotypes have largely been limited to its transcriptional activity. Herein, we demonstrate that ERα coordinates its transcriptional output with selective modulation of mRNA translation. Importantly, translational perturbations caused by depletion of ERα largely manifest as ?translational offsetting? of the transcriptome, whereby amounts of translated mRNAs and corresponding protein levels are maintained constant despite changes in mRNA abundance. Transcripts whose levels, but not polysome association, are reduced following ERα depletion lack features which limit translation efficiency including structured 5?UTRs and miRNA target sites. In contrast, mRNAs induced upon ERα depletion whose polysome association remains unaltered are enriched in codons requiring U34-modified tRNAs for efficient decoding. Consistently, ERα regulates levels of U34-modifying enzymes and thereby controls levels of U34-modified tRNAs. These findings unravel a hitherto unprecedented mechanism of ERα-dependent orchestration of transcriptional and translational programs that may be a pervasive mechanism of proteome maintenance in hormone-dependent cancers.},

APEX relies upon correcting each protein's mass spectrometry sampling depth (observed peptide count) by learned probabilities for identifying the peptides. APEX abundances agree with measurements from controls, western blotting, flow cytometry and two-dimensional gels, as well as known correlations with mRNA abundances and codon bias, providing absolute protein concentrations across approximately three to four orders of magnitude. Using APEX, we demonstrate that 73\% of the variance in yeast protein abundance (47\% in E. coli) is explained by mRNA abundance, with the number of proteins per mRNA log-normally distributed about ∼5,600 (∼540 in E. coli) protein molecules/mRNA. Therefore, levels of both eukaryotic and prokaryotic proteins are set per mRNA molecule and independently of overall protein concentration, with {$>$}70\% of yeast gene expression regulation occurring through mRNA-directed mechanisms.},

  abstract = {The ribosomal protein S6K (S6 kinase) represents an extensively studied effector of the TORC1 [TOR (target of rapamycin) complex 1], which possesses important yet incompletely defined roles in cellular and organismal physiology. TORC1 functions as an environmental sensor by integrating signals derived from diverse environmental cues to promote anabolic and inhibit catabolic cellular functions. mTORC1 (mammalian TORC1) phosphorylates and activates S6K1 and S6K2, whose first identified substrate was rpS6 (ribosomal protein S6), a component of the 40S ribosome. Studies over the past decade have uncovered a number of additional S6K1 substrates, revealing multiple levels at which the mTORC1-S6K1 axis regulates cell physiology. The results thus far indicate that the mTORC1-S6K1 axis controls fundamental cellular processes, including transcription, translation, protein and lipid synthesis, cell growth/size and cell metabolism. In the present review we summarize the regulation of S6Ks, their cellular substrates and functions, and their integration within rapidly expanding mTOR (mammalian TOR) signalling networks. Although our understanding of the role of mTORC1-S6K1 signalling in physiology remains in its infancy, evidence indicates that this signalling axis controls, at least in part, glucose homoeostasis, insulin sensitivity, adipocyte metabolism, body mass and energy balance, tissue and organ size, learning, memory and aging. As dysregulation of this signalling axis contributes to diverse disease states, improved understanding of S6K regulation and function within mTOR signalling networks may enable the development of novel therapeutics.},

  abstract = {The mRNA cap-binding protein eIF4E (eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E) permits ribosome recruitment to capped mRNAs, and its phosphorylated form has an important role in cell transformation. The oncogenic function of eIF4E is, however, antagonised by the hypophosphorylated forms of the inhibitory eIF4E-binding proteins 1 and 2. eIF4E-binding protein 1 and 2 (4E-BP1 and 2) are two major targets of the protein kinase mTOR, and are essential for the antiproliferative effects of mTOR inhibitors. Herein, we report that pancreas expresses specifically and massively 4E-BP1 (4E-BP2 is nearly undetectable). However, 4E-BP1 expression is extinguished in more than half of the human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC). 4E-BP1 shutoff is recapitulated in a mouse genetic model of PDAC, which is based on a pancreas-specific mutation of Kras, the more frequently mutated oncogene in human pancreatic tumours. 4E-BP1 downregulation enhances eIF4E phosphorylation and facilitates pancreatic cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumour development in vivo. Furthermore, 4E-BP1 loss combined with the absence of 4E-BP2 renders eIF4E phosphorylation, protein synthesis and cell proliferation resistant to mTOR inhibition. However, proliferation can be better limited by a recently developed compound that mimics the function of 4E-BP1 and 2 independently of mTOR inhibition.},

The mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a key regulator of translation. Although mTOR affects global protein synthesis, translation of a subset of mRNAs appears to be exceptionally sensitive to changes in mTOR activity. Recent efforts to catalog these mTOR-sensitive mRNAs resulted in conflicting results. Whereas ribosome-profiling almost exclusively identified 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) mRNAs as mTOR-sensitive, polysome-profiling suggested that mTOR also regulates translation of non-TOP mRNAs. This inconsistency was explained by analytical and technical biases limiting the efficiency of ribosome-profiling in detecting mRNAs showing differential translation. Moreover, genome-wide characterization of 5'UTRs of non-TOP mTOR-sensitive mRNAs revealed 2 subsets of transcripts which differ in their requirement for translation initiation factors and biologic functions. We summarize these recent advances and their impact on the understanding of mTOR-sensitive translation.},

This phase Ib study evaluated alpelisib plus letrozole's safety, tolerability, and preliminary activity in patients with metastatic ER+ breast cancer refractory to endocrine therapy. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Twenty-six patients received letrozole and alpelisib daily. Outcomes were assessed by standard solid-tumor phase I methods. Tumor blocks were collected for DNA extraction and next-generation sequencing. RESULTS: Alpelisib's maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) in combination with letrozole was 300 mg/d. Common drug-related adverse events included hyperglycemia, nausea, fatigue, diarrhea, and rash with dose-limiting toxicity occurring at 350 mg/d of alpelisib. The clinical benefit rate (lack of progression ≥6 months) was 35\% (44\% in patients with PIK3CA-mutated and 20\% in PIK3CA wild-type tumors; 95\% CI, 17\%-56\%), including five objective responses. Of eight patients remaining on treatment ≥12 months, six had tumors with a PIK3CA mutation. Among evaluable tumors, those with FGFR1/2 amplification and KRAS and TP53 mutations did not derive clinical benefit. Overexpression of FGFR1 in ER+/PIK3CA mutant breast cancer cells attenuated the response to alpelisib in vitro CONCLUSIONS: The combination of letrozole and alpelisib was safe, with reversible toxicities. Clinical activity was observed independently of PIK3CA mutation status, although clinical benefit was seen in a higher proportion of patients with PIK3CA-mutated tumors. Phase II and III trials of alpelisib and endocrine therapy in patients with ER+ breast cancer are ongoing. Clin Cancer Res; 23(1); 26-34. ©2016 AACR.},

  abstract = {A flexible statistical framework is developed for the analysis of read counts from RNA-Seq gene expression studies. It provides the ability to analyse complex experiments involving multiple treatment conditions and blocking variables while still taking full account of biological variation. Biological variation between RNA samples is estimated separately from the technical variation associated with sequencing technologies. Novel empirical Bayes methods allow each gene to have its own specific variability, even when there are relatively few biological replicates from which to estimate such variability. The pipeline is implemented in the edgeR package of the Bioconductor project. A case study analysis of carcinoma data demonstrates the ability of generalized linear model methods (GLMs) to detect differential expression in a paired design, and even to detect tumour-specific expression changes. The case study demonstrates the need to allow for gene-specific variability, rather than assuming a common dispersion across genes or a fixed relationship between abundance and variability. Genewise dispersions de-prioritize genes with inconsistent results and allow the main analysis to focus on changes that are consistent between biological replicates. Parallel computational approaches are developed to make non-linear model fitting faster and more reliable, making the application of GLMs to genomic data more convenient and practical. Simulations demonstrate the ability of adjusted profile likelihood estimators to return accurate estimators of biological variability in complex situations. When variation is gene-specific, empirical Bayes estimators provide an advantageous compromise between the extremes of assuming common dispersion or separate genewise dispersion. The methods developed here can also be applied to count data arising from DNA-Seq applications, including ChIP-Seq for epigenetic marks and DNA methylation analyses.},

  abstract = {Understanding the patterns and causes of phenotypic divergence is a central goal in evolutionary biology. Much work has shown that mRNA abundance is highly variable between closely related species. However, the extent and mechanisms of post-transcriptional gene regulatory evolution are largely unknown. Here we used ribosome profiling to compare transcript abundance and translation efficiency in two closely related yeast species (S. cerevisiae and S. paradoxus). By comparing translation regulatory divergence to interspecies differences in mRNA sequence features, we show that differences in transcript leaders and codon bias substantially contribute to divergent translation. Globally, we find that translation regulatory divergence often buffers species differences in mRNA abundance, such that ribosome occupancy is more conserved than transcript abundance. We used allele-specific ribosome profiling in interspecies hybrids to compare the relative contributions of cis- and trans-regulatory divergence to species differences in mRNA abundance and translation efficiency. The mode of gene regulatory divergence differs for these processes, as trans-regulatory changes play a greater role in divergent mRNA abundance than in divergent translation efficiency. Strikingly, most genes with aberrant transcript abundance in F1 hybrids (either over- or underexpressed compared to both parent species) did not exhibit aberrant ribosome occupancy. Our results show that interspecies differences in translation contribute substantially to the evolution of gene expression. Compensatory differences in transcript abundance and translation efficiency may increase the robustness of gene regulation.},

However, some transcripts are translated in a cap-independent manner through poorly understood mechanisms. Here, we show that mRNAs containing N(6)-methyladenosine (m(6)A) in their 5' UTR can be translated in a cap-independent manner. A single 5' UTR m(6)A directly binds eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3), which is sufficient to recruit the 43S complex to initiate translation in the absence of the cap-binding factor eIF4E. Inhibition of adenosine methylation selectively reduces translation of mRNAs containing 5'UTR m(6)A. Additionally, increased m(6)A levels in the Hsp70 mRNA regulate its cap-independent translation following heat shock. Notably, we find that diverse cellular stresses induce a transcriptome-wide redistribution of m(6)A, resulting in increased numbers of mRNAs with 5' UTR m(6)A. These data show that 5' UTR m(6)A bypasses 5' cap-binding proteins to promote translation under stresses.},

  abstract = {The synthesis of many mammalian proteins associated with the translational apparatus is selectively regulated by mitogenic and nutritional stimuli, at the translational level. The apparent advantages of the regulation of gene expression at the translational level are the speed and the readily reversible nature of the response to altering physiological conditions. These two features enable cells to rapidly repress the biosynthesis of the translational machinery upon shortage of amino acids or growth arrest, thus rapidly blocking unnecessary energy wastage. Likewise, when amino acids are replenished or mitogenic stimulation is applied, then cells can rapidly respond in resuming the costly biosynthesis of the translational apparatus. A structural hallmark, common to mRNAs encoding many components of the translational machinery, is the presence of a 5’ terminal oligopyrimidine tract (5’TOP), referred to as TOP mRNAs. This structural motif comprises the core of the translational cis-regulatory element of these mRNAs. The present review focuses on the mechanism underlying the translational control of TOP mRNAs upon growth and nutritional stimuli. A special emphasis is put on the pivotal role played by ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) in this mode of regulation, and the upstream regulatory pathways, which might be engaged in transducing external signals into activation of S6K. Finally, the possible involvement of pyrimidine-binding proteins in the translational control of TOP mRNAs is discussed.},

Network structural and functional analyses revealed important nodes within each module of these co-expression networks. Subsequently, we inferred significant dynamic transcriptional regulatory models in leaf senescence using time-course gene expression datasets. Dynamic simulations and predictive network perturbation analyses followed by experimental dataset illustrated the kinetic relationships among TFs and their downstream targets. In conclusion, our network science framework discovers cohorts of TFs and their paths with previously unrecognized roles in leaf senescence and provides a comprehensive landscape of dynamic transcriptional circuitry.},

  abstract = {Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) activity is aberrant in tumors, and PI3K inhibitors are investigated as cancer therapeutics. PI3K signaling mediates insulin action in metabolism, but the role of PI3K isoforms in insulin signaling remains unresolved. Defining the role of PI3K isoforms in insulin signaling is necessary for a mechanistic understanding of insulin action and to develop PI3K inhibitors with optimal therapeutic index. We show that insulin-driven PI3K-AKT signaling depends on redundant PI3Kα and PI3Kβ activities, whereas PI3Kδ and PI3Kγ are largely dispensable. We have also found that RAS activity promotes AKT phosphorylation in insulin-stimulated hepatocytes and that promotion of insulin-driven AKT phosphorylation by RAS depends on PI3Kα. These findings reveal the detailed mechanism by which insulin activates AKT, providing an improved mechanistic understanding of insulin signaling. This improved model for insulin signaling predicts that isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors discriminating between PI3Kα and PI3Kβ should be~dosed below their hyperglycemic threshold to achieve isoform selectivity.},

  abstract = {Control of gene expression in erythropoiesis has to respond to signals that may emerge from intracellular processes or environmental factors. Control of mRNA translation allows for relatively rapid modulation of protein synthesis from the existing transcriptome. For instance, the protein synthesis rate needs to be reduced when reactive oxygen species or unfolded proteins accumulate in the cells, but also when iron supply is low or when growth factors are lacking in the environment. In addition, regulation of mRNA translation can be important as an additional layer of control on top of gene transcription, in which RNA binding proteins (RBPs) can modify translation of a set of transcripts to the cell's actual protein requirement. The 5' and 3' untranslated regions of mRNA (5'UTR, 3'UTR) contain binding sites for general and sequence specific translation factors. They also contain secondary structures that may hamper scanning of the 5'UTR by translation complexes or may help to recruit translation factors. In addition, the term 5'UTR is not fully correct because many transcripts contain small open reading frames in their 5'UTR that are translated and contribute to regulation of mRNA translation. It is becoming increasingly clear that the transcriptome only partly predicts the proteome. The aim of this review is (i) to summarize how the availability of general translation initiation factors can selectively regulate transcripts because the 5'UTR contains secondary structures or short translated sequences, (ii) to discuss mechanisms that control the length of the mRNA poly(A) tail in relation to mRNA translation, and (iii) to give examples of sequence specific RBPs and their targets. We focused on transcripts and RBPs required for erythropoiesis. Whereas differentiation of erythroblasts to erythrocytes is orchestrated by erythroid transcription factors, the production of erythrocytes needs to respond to the availability of growth factors and nutrients, particularly the availability of iron.},

Consistently, human and mouse PDAC lose expression of the translational repressor and mTOR target 4E-BP1. Using genome-wide polysome profiling, we here explore mRNAs whose translational efficiencies depend on the mTOR/4E-BP1 axis in pancreatic cancer cells. We identified a functional enrichment for mRNAs encoding DNA replication and repair proteins, including RRM2 and CDC6. Consequently, 4E-BP1 depletion favors DNA repair and renders DNA replication insensitive to mTOR inhibitors, in correlation with a sustained protein expression of CDC6 and RRM2, which is inversely correlated with 4E-BP1 expression in PDAC patient samples. DNA damage and pancreatic lesions induced by an experimental pancreatitis model uncover that 4E-BP1/2-deleted mice display an increased acinar cell proliferation and a better recovery than WT animals. Targeting translation, independently of 4E-BP1 status, using eIF4A RNA helicase inhibitors (silvestrol derivatives) selectively modulates translation and limits CDC6 expression and DNA replication, leading to reduced PDAC tumor growth. In summary, 4E-BP1 expression loss during PDAC development induces selective changes in translation of mRNA encoding DNA replication and repair protein. Importantly, targeting protein synthesis by eIF4A inhibitors circumvents PDAC resistance to mTOR inhibition.},

  abstract = {In this study we have identified a functional role for miR-29a in cancer cell invasion and proliferation. MiRNA expression profiling of human NSCLC cell lines indicated that miR-29a levels were reduced in more invasive cell lines. Exogenous overexpression of miR-29a in both lung and pancreatic cancer cell lines resulted in a significant reduction in the invasion phenotype, as well as in proliferation. 2D DIGE proteomic profiling of cells transfected with pre-miR-29a or anti-miR-29a resulted in the identification of over 100 differentially regulated proteins. The fold change of protein expression was generally modest--in the range 1.2-1.7-fold. Only 14 were predicted computationally to have miR-29a seed sequences in their 3' UTR region. Subsequent studies using siRNA to knock down several candidate proteins from the 2D DIGE experiment identified RAN (a member of the RAS oncogene family) which significantly reduced the invasive capability of a model lung cancer cell line. We conclude that miR-29a has a significant anti-invasive and anti-proliferative effect on lung cancer cells in vitro and functions as an anti-oncomir. This function is likely mediated through the post-transcriptional fine tuning of the cellular levels of several proteins, both directly and indirectly, and in particular we provide some evidence that RAN represents one of these.},

Relative to mRNAs which were polyadenylated, we found that nonpolyadenylated [poly(A)-]mRNAs had a reduced translational capacity which was not due to an increase in their decay rates, but was attributable to a reduction in their efficiency of recruitment into polysomes. The defect in poly(A)- mRNAs affected a late step in translational initiation, was distinct from the phenotype associated with cap-deficient mRNAs, and resulted in a reduced ability to form 80S initiation complexes. Moreover, poly(A) added in trans inhibited translation from capped polyadenylated mRNAs but stimulated translation from capped poly(A)- mRNAs. We suggest that the presence of a 3' poly(A) tail may facilitate the binding of an initiation factor or ribosomal subunit at the mRNA 5' end.},

Our results show that hypoxia through hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) brings about a time-dependent increase in the level of an oncogenic microRNA, miR-191 in various breast cancer cell lines. miR-191 enhances breast cancer aggressiveness by promoting cell proliferation, migration and survival under hypoxia. We further established that miR-191 is a critical regulator of transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ)-signaling and promotes cell migration by inducing TGFβ2 expression under hypoxia through direct binding and indirectly by regulating levels of a RNA binding protein, human antigen R (HuR). The levels of several TGFβ pathway genes (like VEGFA, SMAD3, CTGF and BMP4) were found to be higher in miR-191 overexpressing cells. Lastly, anti-miR-191 treatment given to breast tumor spheroids led to drastic reduction in spheroid tumor volume. This stands as a first report of identification of a microRNA mediator that links hypoxia and the TGFβ signaling pathways, both of which are involved in regulation of breast cancer metastasis. Together, our results show a critical role of miR-191 in hypoxia-induced cancer progression and suggest that miR-191 inhibition may offer a novel therapy for hypoxic breast tumors.},

Cells lacking U34 modifications exhibit gene expression hallmarks of~proteotoxic stress, accumulate aggregates of endogenous proteins, and are severely compromised in clearing stress-induced protein aggregates. Overexpression of hypomodified tRNAs alleviates ribosome pausing, concomitantly restoring protein homeostasis.

RUST is robust and outperforms other normalization techniques in the presence of heterogeneous noise. We illustrate how RUST can be used for identifying mRNA sequence features that affect ribosome footprint densities globally. We show that a few parameters extracted with RUST are sufficient for predicting experimental densities with high accuracy. Importantly the application of RUST to 30 publicly available Ribo-seq data sets revealed a substantial variation in sequence determinants of ribosome footprint frequencies, questioning the reliability of Ribo-seq as an accurate representation of local ribosome densities without prior quality control.

In this study, we find that mTORC2 can colocalize with actively translating ribosomes and can stably interact with rpL23a, a large ribosomal subunit protein present at the tunnel exit. Exclusively during translation of Akt, mTORC2 mediates phosphorylation of the nascent polypeptide at the turn motif (TM) site, Thr450, to avoid cotranslational Akt ubiquitination. Constitutive TM phosphorylation occurs because the TM site is accessible, whereas the hydrophobic motif (Ser473) site is concealed in the ribosomal tunnel. Thus, mTORC2 can function cotranslationally by phosphorylating residues in nascent chains that are critical to attain proper conformation. Our findings reveal that mTOR links protein production with quality control.},

  abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are pervasively expressed and regulate most biological functions. They function by modulating transcriptional and translational programs and therefore they orchestrate both physiological and pathological processes, such as development, cell differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis and tumor growth. miRNAs work as small guide molecules in RNA silencing, by negatively regulating the expression of several genes both at mRNA and protein level, by degrading their mRNA target and/or by silencing translation. One of the most recent advances in the field is the comprehension of their role in oncogenesis. The number of miRNA genes is increasing and an alteration in the level of miRNAs is involved in the initiation, progression and metastases formation of several tumors. Some tumor types show a distinct miRNA signature that distinguishes them from normal tissues and from other cancer types. Genetic and biochemical evidence supports the essential role of miRNAs in tumor development. Although the abnormal expression of miRNAs in cancer cells is a widely accepted phenomenon, the cause of this dysregulation is still unknown. Here, we discuss the biogenesis of miRNAs, focusing on the mechanisms by which they regulate protein synthesis. In addition we debate on their role in cancer, highlighting their potential to become therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {Motivation: The translational landscape of diverse cellular systems remains largely uncharacterized. A detailed understanding of the control of gene expression at the level of messenger RNA translation is vital to elucidating a systems-level view of complex molecular programs in the cell. Establishing the degree to which such post-transcriptional regulation can mediate specific phenotypes is similarly critical to elucidating the molecular pathogenesis of diseases such as cancer. Recently, methods for massively parallel sequencing of ribosome-bound fragments of messenger RNA have begun to uncover genome-wide translational control at codon resolution. Despite its promise for deeply characterizing mammalian proteomes, few analytical methods exist for the comprehensive analysis of this paired RNA and ribosome data., Results: We describe the Babel framework, an analytical methodology for assessing the significance of changes in translational regulation within cells and between conditions. This approach facilitates the analysis of translation genome-wide while allowing statistically principled gene-level inference. Babel is based on an errors-in-variables regression model that uses the negative binomial distribution and draws inference using a parametric bootstrap approach. We demonstrate the operating characteristics of Babel on simulated data and use its gene-level inference to extend prior analyses significantly, discovering new translationally regulated modules under mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway signaling control., Availability: The Babel framework is freely available as source code at http://taylorlab.ucsf.edu/software\_data.html., Contact: barry.taylor@ucsf.edu, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Recent evidence has strengthened the proposed synergistic relationship between obesity-related insulin resistance (IR) and/or diabetes mellitus (DM) and cancer. Within the past year, many studies have examined this relationship. Although the precise mechanisms and pathways are uncertain, it is becoming clear that hyperinsulinemia and possibly sustained hyperglycemia are important regulators of not only the development of cancer but also of treatment outcome. Further, clinical decision-making regarding the treatment of choice for DM will likely be impacted as we learn more about the non-metabolic effects of the available hyperglycemic agents. In our review, we endeavored to synthesize the recent literature and provide a concise view of the journey from macro-level clinical associations to specific mechanistic relationships being elucidated in cell lines and animal models.},

  abstract = {The mechanisms of steroid and peptide hormone action in human breast cancer are poorly understood. We have previously characterized a cell line of human breast cancer in long-term tissue culture that possesses various steroid hormone receptors and responses, providing a model for the study of steroid hormone action. The present studies describe a human breast cancer in vitro that responds to physiologie concentrations of insulin with an increased rate of macromolecular synthesis and growth. Thymidine and uridine incorporation in cells in serum-free medium are stimulated by 10(-11) M insulin and are maximal with 10(-8) M. Leucine incorporation is stimulated by 5 X 10(-11) M insulin and is maximal with 10(-9) M. Significant stimulation of uridine and leucine incorporation is evident by 3 hr and maximal by 10 hr. A 10-hr lag period exists for insulin stimulation of thymidine incorporation, which is maximal form 14 to 24 hr. The effect of 10(-8) M insulin on macromolecular synthesis is accompanied by a 69\% increase above controls in the number of cells after 24 hr. The effect on macromolecular synthesis is observed in glucose-free medium. Insulin's effect on protein synthesis is not blocked by inhibition of RNA synthesis with actinomycin D. Glucocorticoids partially inhibit the action of insulin in these cells. This system provides a model for studying insulin action, and suggests that some human breast cancer may show growth regulation by insulin.},

  abstract = {Abstract In response to diverse stress stimuli, eukaryotic cells activate a common adaptive pathway, termed the integrated stress response (ISR), to restore cellular homeostasis. The core event in this pathway is the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha (eIF2α) by one of four members of the eIF2α kinase family, which leads to a decrease in global protein synthesis and the induction of selected genes, including the transcription factor ATF4, that together promote cellular recovery. The gene expression program activated by the ISR optimizes the cellular response to stress and is dependent on the cellular context, as well as on the nature and intensity of the stress stimuli. Although the ISR is primarily a pro-survival, homeostatic program, exposure to severe stress can drive signaling toward cell death. Here, we review current understanding of the ISR signaling and how it regulates cell fate under diverse types of stress.},

  abstract = {Iron regulatory protein 1 (IRP-1) binding to an iron-responsive element (IRE) located close to the cap structure of mRNAs represses translation by precluding the recruitment of the small ribosomal subunit to these mRNAs. This mechanism is position dependent; reporter mRNAs bearing IREs located further downstream exhibit diminished translational control in transfected mammalian cells. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we have recapitulated this position effect in a rabbit reticulocyte cell-free translation system. We show that the recruitment of the 43S preinitiation complex to the mRNA is unaffected when IRP-1 is bound to a cap-distal IRE. Following 43S complex recruitment, the translation initiation apparatus appears to stall, before linearly progressing to the initiation codon. The slow passive dissociation rate of IRP-1 from the cap-distal IRE suggests that the mammalian translation apparatus plays an active role in overcoming the cap-distal IRE–IRP-1 complex. In contrast, cap-distal IRE–IRP-1 complexes efficiently repress translation in wheat germ and yeast translation extracts. Since inhibition occurs subsequent to 43S complex recruitment, an efficient arrest of productive scanning may represent a second mechanism by which RNA-protein interactions within the 5′ untranslated region of an mRNA can regulate translation. In contrast to initiating ribosomes, elongating ribosomes from mammal, plant, and yeast cells are unaffected by IRE–IRP-1 complexes positioned within the open reading frame. These data shed light on a characteristic aspect of the IRE-IRP regulatory system and uncover properties of the initiation and elongation translation apparatus of eukaryotic cells.},

  abstract = {Purpose To improve on current standards for breast cancer prognosis and prediction of chemotherapy benefit by developing a risk model that incorporates the gene expression–based “intrinsic” subtypes luminal A, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like. Methods A 50-gene subtype predictor was developed using microarray and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction data from 189 prototype samples. Test sets from 761 patients (no systemic therapy) were evaluated for prognosis, and 133 patients were evaluated for prediction of pathologic complete response (pCR) to a taxane and anthracycline regimen. Results The intrinsic subtypes as discrete entities showed prognostic significance (P = 2.26E-12) and remained significant in multivariable analyses that incorporated standard parameters (estrogen receptor status, histologic grade, tumor size, and node status). A prognostic model for node-negative breast cancer was built using intrinsic subtype and clinical information. The C-index estimate for the combined model (subtype and tumor size) was a significant improvement on either the clinicopathologic model or subtype model alone. The intrinsic subtype model predicted neoadjuvant chemotherapy efficacy with a negative predictive value for pCR of 97\%. Conclusion Diagnosis by intrinsic subtype adds significant prognostic and predictive information to standard parameters for patients with breast cancer. The prognostic properties of the continuous risk score will be of value for the management of node-negative breast cancers. The subtypes and risk score can also be used to assess the likelihood of efficacy from neoadjuvant chemotherapy.},

  abstract = {The mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) protein kinase is an important regulator of cell growth. Two complexes of mTOR have been identified: complex 1, consisting of mTOR-Raptor (regulatory associated protein of mTOR)-mLST8 (termed mTORC1), and complex 2, comprising mTOR-Rictor (rapamycininsensitive companion of mTOR)-mLST8-Sin1 (termed mTORC2). mTORC1 phosphorylates the p70 ribosomal S6K (S6 kinase) at its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), whereas mTORC2 phosphorylates PKB (protein kinase B) at its hydrophobic motif (Ser473). In the present study, we report that widely expressed isoforms of unstudied proteins termed Protor-1 (protein observed with Rictor-1) and Protor-2 interact with Rictor and are components of mTORC2. We demonstrate that immunoprecipitation of Protor-1 or Protor-2 results in the co-immunoprecipitation of other mTORC2 subunits, but not Raptor, a specific component of mTORC1. We show that detergents such as Triton X-100 or n-octylglucoside dissociate mTOR and mLST8 from a complex of Protor-1, Sin1 and Rictor. We also provide evidence that Rictor regulates the expression of Protor-1, and that Protor-1 is not required for the assembly of other mTORC2 subunits into a complex. Protor-1 is a novel Rictor-binding subunit of mTORC2, but further work is required to establish its role.},

While many RNA-binding proteins have been shown to bind to AREs in vitro, neither the functional consequences nor the physiological significance of their interactions are known. Here we demonstrate a role for the embryonic lethal abnormal visual (ELAV) RNA-binding protein HuR in mRNA turnover in vivo. The ELAV family of RNA-binding proteins is highly conserved in vertebrates. In humans, there are four members; HuR is expressed in all proliferating cells, whereas Hel-N1, HuC and HuD are expressed in terminally differentiated neurons. We show that elevation of cytoplasmic HuR levels inhibits c-fos ARE-mediated RNA decay but has little effect on rapid decay directed by c-jun ARE. It appears that HuR has little effect on deadenylation but delays onset of decay of the RNA body and slows down its subsequent decay. We also show that HuR can be induced to redistribute from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and that this redistribution is associated with an altered function. Modulation of the ARE-mediated decay pathway through controlling distribution of the ELAV proteins between nucleus and cytoplasm may be a mechanism by which cell growth and differentiation is regulated.},

Although recycling of eukaryotic posttermination complexes (post-TCs) can be mediated by initiation factors eIF3, eIF1, and eIF1A (Pisarev et~al., 2007), this energy-free mechanism can function only in a narrow range of low Mg2+ concentrations. Here, we report that ABCE1, a conserved and essential member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of proteins, promotes eukaryotic ribosomal recycling over a wide range of Mg2+ concentrations. ABCE1 dissociates post-TCs into free 60S subunits and mRNA- and tRNA-bound 40S subunits. It can hydrolyze ATP, GTP, UTP, and CTP. NTP hydrolysis by ABCE1 is stimulated by post-TCs and is required for its recycling activity. Importantly, ABCE1 dissociates only post-TCs obtained with eRF1/eRF3 (or eRF1 alone), but not post-TCs obtained with puromycin in eRF1's absence.},

Because ribosomal protein-encoding genes (RPGs) are highly overrepresented in the set of intron-containing genes, we tested the hypothesis that splicing of these transcripts would be regulated under conditions in which translation is impaired. Using a microarray-based strategy, we find that, within minutes after the induction of amino acid starvation, the splicing of the majority of RPGs is specifically inhibited. In response to an unrelated stress, exposure to toxic levels of ethanol, splicing of a different group of transcripts is inhibited, while the splicing of a third set is actually improved. We propose that regulation of splicing, like transcription, can afford rapid and specific changes in gene expression in response to the environment.},

  abstract = {The conserved serine/threonine kinase mTOR (the mammalian target of rapamycin), a downstream effector of the PI3K/AKT pathway, forms two distinct multiprotein complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2. mTORC1 is sensitive to rapamycin, activates S6K1 and 4EBP1, which are involved in mRNA translation. It is activated by diverse stimuli, such as growth factors, nutrients, energy and stress signals, and essential signalling pathways, such as PI3K, MAPK and AMPK, in order to control cell growth, proliferation and survival. mTORC2 is considered resistant to rapamycin and is generally insensitive to nutrients and energy signals. It activates PKC-α and AKT and regulates the actin cytoskeleton. Deregulation of multiple elements of the mTOR pathway (PI3K amplification/mutation, PTEN loss of function, AKT overexpression, and S6K1, 4EBP1 and eIF4E overexpression) has been reported in many types of cancers, particularly in melanoma, where alterations in major components of the mTOR pathway were reported to have significant effects on tumour progression. Therefore, mTOR is an appealing therapeutic target and mTOR inhibitors, including the rapamycin analogues deforolimus, everolimus and temsirolimus, are submitted to clinical trials for treating multiple cancers, alone or in combination with inhibitors of other pathways. Importantly, temsirolimus and everolimus were recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma, PNET and giant cell astrocytoma. Small molecules that inhibit mTOR kinase activity and dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors are also being developed. In this review, we aim to survey relevant research, the molecular mechanisms of signalling, including upstream activation and downstream effectors, and the role of mTOR in cancer, mainly in melanoma.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The clinical impact of the biological heterogeneity within HER2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer is not fully understood. Here, we evaluated the molecular features and survival outcomes of the intrinsic subtypes within HER2+ breast cancer. METHODS: We interrogated The Cancer Genome Atlas (n = 495) and Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) datasets (n = 1730) of primary breast cancers for molecular data derived from DNA, RNA and protein, and determined intrinsic subtype. Clinical HER2 status was defined according to American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) guidelines or DNA copy-number aberration by single nucleotide polymorphism arrays. Cox models tested the prognostic significance of each variable in patients not treated with trastuzumab (n = 1711). RESULTS: Compared with clinically HER2 (cHER2)-negative breast cancer, cHER2+ breast cancer had a higher frequency of the HER2-enriched (HER2E) subtype (47.0\% vs 7.1\%) and a lower frequency of Luminal A (10.7\% vs 39.0\%) and Basal-like (14.1\% vs 23.4\%) subtypes. The likelihood of cHER2-positivity in HER2E, Luminal B, Basal-like and Luminal A subtypes was 64.6\%, 20.0\%, 14.4\% and 7.3\%, respectively. Within each subtype, only 0.3\% to 3.9\% of genes were found differentially expressed between cHER2+ and cHER2-negative tumors. Within cHER2+ tumors, HER2 gene and protein expression was statistically significantly higher in the HER2E and Basal-like subtypes than either luminal subtype. Neither cHER2 status nor the new 10-subtype copy number-based classification system (IntClust) added independent prognostic value to intrinsic subtype. CONCLUSIONS: When the intrinsic subtypes are taken into account, cHER2-positivity does not translate into large changes in the expression of downstream signaling pathways, nor does it affect patient survival in the absence of HER2 targeting.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND \& AIMS: Genomic studies have revealed subtypes of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) based on their molecular features, but different studies have reported different classification systems. It is a challenge to obtain high-quality, freshly frozen tissue for clinical analysis and determination of PDA subtypes. We aimed to redefine subtypes of PDA using a large number of formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded PDA samples, which are more amenable to routine clinical evaluation. METHODS: We collected PDA samples from 309 consecutive patients who underwent surgery from September 1996 through December 2010 at 4 academic hospitals in Europe; nontumor tissue samples were not included. Samples were formalin fixed and paraffin embedded. DNA and RNA were isolated; gene expression, targeted DNA sequencing, and immunohistochemical analyses were performed. We used independent component analysis to deconvolute normal, tumor, and microenvironment transcriptome patterns in samples. We devised classification systems from an unsupervised analysis using a consensus clustering approach of our data set after removing normal contamination components. We associated subtypes with overall survival and disease-free survival of patients using Cox proportional hazards regression with estimation of hazard ratios and 95\% confidence interval. We used The Cancer Genome Consortium and International Cancer Genome Consortium PDA data sets as validation cohorts. RESULTS: We validated the previously reported basal-like and classical tumor-specific subtypes of PDAs. We identified features of the PDA, including microenvironment gene expression patterns, that allowed tumors to be categorized into 5 subtypes, called pure basal like, stroma activated, desmoplastic, pure classical, and immune classical. These PDA subtypes have features of cancer cells and immune cells that could be targeted by pharmacologic agents. Tumor subtypes were associated with patient outcomes, based on analysis of our data set and the International Cancer Genome Consortium and The Cancer Genome Consortium PDA data sets. We also observed an exocrine signal associated with acinar cell contamination (from pancreatic tissue). CONCLUSIONS: We identified a classification system based on gene expression analysis of formalin-fixed PDA samples. We identified 5 PDA subtypes, based on features of cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. This system might be used to select therapies and predict patient outcomes. We found evidence that the previously reported exocrine-like (called ADEX) tumor subtype resulted from contamination with pancreatic acinar cells. ArrayExpress accession number: E-MTAB-6134.},

  abstract = {Cancer is a complex set of diseases, driven by genomic instability overlaid with epigenetic modifications. Two prevailing concepts, the stochastic theory and the hierarchical theory, are traditionally used to understand tumor progression. These seemingly contradictory theories can be reconciled with the concept of cellular plasticity, such that certain genetic mutations enable epigenetic alterations in cell fate. A growing body of evidence suggests that cancer cells co-opt embryonic stem cell-associated regulatory networks in order to sustain tumor cell plasticity concomitant with growth and progression. The expression of these stem cell associated factors is regulated by dynamic niches, characterized by cellderived proteins as well as biophysical features such low oxygen tensions. In this review we describe specific embryo-associated proteins such as NODAL, NOTCH, and canonical WNT, which cooperate to maintain stem cell phenotypes in cancer. We also illustrate how biophysical factors, in particular oxygen, can orchestrate plasticity by modulating the expression of stem cell-associated proteins. As the microenvironment is known to play a key role in cellular regulation, it is essential to understand its role in cancer progression in order to improve and create new therapies.},

  abstract = {The antizyme protein, Oaz1, regulates synthesis of the polyamines putrescine, spermidine and spermine by controlling stability of the polyamine biosynthetic enzyme, ornithine decarboxylase. Antizyme mRNA translation depends upon a polyamine-stimulated +1 ribosomal frameshift, forming a complex negative feedback system in which the translational frameshifting event may be viewed in engineering terms as a feedback controller for intracellular polyamine concentrations. In this article, we present the first systems level study of the characteristics of this feedback controller, using an integrated experimental and modeling approach. Quantitative analysis of mutant yeast strains in which polyamine synthesis and interconversion were blocked revealed marked variations in frameshift responses to the different polyamines. Putrescine and spermine, but not spermidine, showed evidence of co-operative stimulation of frameshifting and the existence of multiple ribosome binding sites. Combinatorial polyamine treatments showed polyamines compete for binding to common ribosome sites. Using concepts from enzyme kinetics and control engineering, a mathematical model of the translational controller was developed to describe these complex ribosomal responses to combinatorial polyamine effects. Each one of a range of model predictions was successfully validated against experimental frameshift frequencies measured in S-adenosylmethionine-decarboxylase and antizyme mutants, as well as in the wild-type genetic background.},

PI3K inhibitors thus have considerable potential as molecular cancer therapeutics. Here, we detail the pharmacologic properties of a prototype of a new series of inhibitors of class I PI3K. PI103 is a potent inhibitor with low IC50 values against recombinant PI3K isoforms p110alpha (2 nmol/L), p110beta (3 nmol/L), p110delta (3 nmol/L), and p110gamma (15 nmol/L). PI103 also inhibited TORC1 by 83.9\% at 0.5 micromol/L and exhibited an IC50 of 14 nmol/L against DNA-PK. A high degree of selectivity for the PI3K family was shown by the lack of activity of PI103 in a panel of 70 protein kinases. PI103 potently inhibited proliferation and invasion of a wide variety of human cancer cells in vitro and showed biomarker modulation consistent with inhibition of PI3K signaling. PI103 was extensively metabolized, but distributed rapidly to tissues and tumors. This resulted in tumor growth delay in eight different human cancer xenograft models with various PI3K pathway abnormalities. Decreased phosphorylation of AKT was observed in U87MG gliomas, consistent with drug levels achieved. We also showed inhibition of invasion in orthotopic breast and ovarian cancer xenograft models and obtained evidence that PI103 has antiangiogenic potential. Despite its rapid in vivo metabolism, PI103 is a valuable tool compound for exploring the biological function of class I PI3K and importantly represents a lead for further optimization of this novel class of targeted molecular cancer therapeutic.},

We found that the amino acid composition of synthesized proteins is as important a determinant of translation elongation rate as parameters related to codon and transfer RNA (tRNA) adaptation. We did not find evidence of ribosome collisions curbing the protein output of yeast transcripts, either in high translation conditions associated with exponential growth, or in strains in which deletion of individual ribosomal protein (RP) genes leads to globally increased or decreased translation. Slow translation elongation is characteristic of RP-encoding transcripts, which have markedly lower protein output compared with other transcripts with equally high ribosome densities.},

In the present study, we examined the structural features of the 5' TL that overcome this suppressive influence in cells of nonlymphoid origin. Initiation at the downstream cistron in nonlymphoid cells is by a cap-dependent mechanism that requires ribosome scanning along the 5' TL and does not involve an internal ribosome entry site. Extending the uORF so that it overlapped the major cistron by 101 nucleotides had no effect on translation of the downstream cistron in either HeLa or Jurkat cells. When the distance between the uORF and the cap was extended to 47 nucleotides, using sequence previously found to be neutral, translation of the major cistron was inhibited 5-fold in HeLa cells and the mRNA was moved from polysomes to monosomes, a location identical to that of the wild type mRNA in Jurkat cells. Therefore, in contrast to T cells, initiation at the uORF seems to be relatively infrequent in non-lymphoid cells due to its proximity to the cap, allowing efficient translation of the downstream cistron.},

Translation regulation is largely exerted at initiation through the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4 F (eIF4F). eIF4F is pivotal for oncogenic signaling as it integrates mitogenic signals to amplify production of pro-growth and pro-survival factors. Convergence of these signals on eIF4F positions this factor as a gatekeeper of malignant fate. While the oncogenic properties of eIF4F have been characterized, genome-wide evaluation of eIF4F translational output is incomplete yet critical for developing novel translation-targeted therapies.},

  abstract = {Whether codon usage fine-tunes mRNA translation in mammals remains controversial, with recent papers suggesting that production of proteins in specific Gene Ontological (GO) pathways can be regulated by actively modifying the codon and anticodon pools in different cellular conditions. In this work, we compared the sequence content of genes in specific GO categories with the exonic genome background. Although a substantial fraction of variability in codon usage could be explained by random sampling, almost half of GO sets showed more variability in codon usage than expected by chance. Nevertheless, by quantifying translational efficiency in healthy and cancerous tissues in human and mouse, we demonstrated that a given tRNA pool can equally well translate many different sets of mRNAs, irrespective of their cell-type specificity. This disconnect between variations in codon usage and the stability of translational efficiency is best explained by differences in GC content between gene sets. GC variation across the mammalian genome is most likely a result of the interplay between genome repair and gene duplication mechanisms, rather than selective pressures caused by codon-driven translational rates. Consequently, codon usage differences in mammalian transcriptomes are most easily explained by well-understood mutational biases acting on the underlying genome.},

It has now been established that genetic alterations in several components of the translational apparatus underlie spontaneous cancers as well as an entire class of inherited syndromes known as "ribosomopathies" associated with increased cancer susceptibility. These discoveries have illuminated the importance of deregulations in translational control to very specific cellular processes that contribute to cancer etiology. In addition, a growing body of evidence supports the view that deregulation of translational control is a common mechanism by which diverse oncogenic pathways promote cellular transformation and tumor development. Indeed, activation of these key oncogenic pathways induces rapid and dramatic translational reprogramming both by increasing overall protein synthesis and by modulating specific mRNA networks. These translational changes promote cellular transformation, impacting almost every phase of tumor development. This paradigm represents a new frontier in the multihit model of cancer formation and offers significant promise for innovative cancer therapies. Current research, in conjunction with cutting edge technologies, will further enable us to explore novel mechanisms of translational control, functionally identify translationally controlled mRNA groups, and unravel their impact on cellular transformation and tumorigenesis.},

The aim of this study was to determine the level of expression of eIF4E and eIF4E-binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) in esophageal cancer. DESIGN AND METHODS: Tumor and normal adjacent tissue samples (as controls) were obtained from 99 patients with esophageal cancer. eIF4E and 4E-BP1 levels were determined by using Western blot analysis. eIF4E was purified by affinity chromatography using m(7)GTP-sepharose, and the levels of 4E-BP1 bound to eIF4E were determined. RESULTS: : In cancerous esophageal tissues, eIF4E level was elevated by a mean of 12.59 +/- 1.66-fold, and 4E-BP1 was elevated by a mean of 15.76 +/- 2.45-fold when compared to normal adjacent tissues. Both eIF4E and 4E-BP1 expressions were higher in cancerous compared to noncancerous esophageal tissues. CONCLUSIONS: A higher expression of eIF4E was correlated with advanced stages. The inverse relationship found between the increases in 4E-BP1 levels observed in esophagus tumors and lymph node involvement would support the hypothesis that the overexpression of eIF4E can be involved in tumorigenesis and a possible role of 4E-BP1 as a prognostic factor in esophageal cancer.},

  abstract = {Regulation of the MYC oncogene remains unclear. Using 10058-F4, a compound that inhibits MYC-MAX transcription factor, MYC protein and gene expression were down-regulated in Namalwa cells, a Burkitt lymphoma. Compound 10058-F4 decreased MYC mRNA (45\%), MYC protein (50\%), and cell growth (32\%). MYC-MAX transcription factor was disrupted 24 h after treatment, resulting in transcriptional inhibition of target genes. Because microRNAs (miRNA) disrupt mRNA translation, let-7a, let-7b, and mir-98 were selected using bioinformatics for targeting MYC. Inhibition of MYC-MAX transcription factor with 10058-F4 increased levels of members of the let-7 family. In inhibited cells at 24 h, let-7a, let-7b, and mir-98 were induced 4.9-, 1.3-, and 2.4-fold, respectively, whereas mir-17-5p decreased 0.23-fold. These results were duplicated using microRNA multianalyte suspension array technology. Regulation of MYC mRNA by let-7a was confirmed by transfections with pre-let-7a. Overexpression of let-7a (190\%) decreased Myc mRNA (70\%) and protein (75\%). Down-regulation of Myc protein and mRNA using siRNA MYC also elevated let-7a miRNA and decreased Myc gene expression. Inverse coordinate regulation of let-7a and mir-17-5p versus Myc mRNA by 10058-F4, pre-let-7a, or siRNA MYC suggested that both miRNAs are Myc-regulated. This supports previous results in lung and colon cancer where decreased levels of the let-7 family resulted in increased tumorigenicity. Here, pre-let-7a transfections led to down-regulation of expression of MYC and its target genes and antiproliferation in lymphoma cells. These findings with let-7a add to the complexity of MYC regulation and suggest that dysregulation of these miRNAs participates in the genesis and maintenance of the lymphoma phenotype in Burkitt lymphoma cells and other MYC-dysregulated cancers.},

We find that the Rag proteins—a family of four related small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases)—interact with mTORC1 in an amino acid–sensitive manner and are necessary for the activation of the mTORC1 pathway by amino acids. A Rag mutant that is constitutively bound to guanosine triphosphate interacted strongly with mTORC1, and its expression within cells made the mTORC1 pathway resistant to amino acid deprivation. Conversely, expression of a guanosine diphosphate–bound Rag mutant prevented stimulation of mTORC1 by amino acids. The Rag proteins do not directly stimulate the kinase activity of mTORC1, but, like amino acids, promote the intracellular localization of mTOR to a compartment that also contains its activator Rheb. Nutrients, specifically amino acids, are sensed by small guanosine triphosphatases, which bind to a signaling complex, moving it close to the nucleus where it initiates cell growth.

  abstract = {AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase) is activated allosterically by AMP and by phosphorylation of Thr172 within the catalytic alpha subunit. Here we show that mutations in the regulatory gamma subunit reduce allosteric activation of the kinase by AMP. In addition to its allosteric effect, AMP significantly reduces the dephosphorylation of Thr172 by PP (protein phosphatase)2Calpha. Moreover, a mutation in the gamma subunit almost completely abolishes the inhibitory effect of AMP on dephosphorylation. We were unable to detect any effect of AMP on Thr172 phosphorylation by either LKB1 or CaMKKbeta (Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase beta) using recombinant preparations of the proteins. However, using partially purified AMPK from rat liver, there was an apparent AMP-stimulation of Thr172 phosphorylation by LKB1, but this was blocked by the addition of NaF, a PP inhibitor. Western blotting of partially purified rat liver AMPK and LKB1 revealed the presence of PP2Calpha in the preparations. We suggest that previous studies reporting that AMP promotes phosphorylation of Thr172 were misinterpreted. A plausible explanation for this effect of AMP is inhibition of dephosphorylation by PP2Calpha, present in the preparations of the kinases used in the earlier studies. Taken together, our results demonstrate that AMP activates AMPK via two mechanisms: by direct allosteric activation and by protecting Thr172 from dephosphorylation. On the basis of our new findings, we propose a simple model for the regulation of AMPK in mammalian cells by LKB1 and CaMKKbeta. This model accounts for activation of AMPK by two distinct signals: a Ca2+-dependent pathway, mediated by CaMKKbeta and an AMP-dependent pathway, mediated by LKB1.},

This study demonstrates the surprisingly sophisticated regulation of Fli-1 mRNA translation. We establish that two FLI-1 protein isoforms (of 51 and 48 kDa) detected by Western blotting in vivo are synthesized by alternative translation initiation through the use of two highly conserved in-frame initiation codons, AUG +1 and AUG +100. Furthermore, we show that the synthesis of these two FLI-1 isoforms is regulated by two short overlapping 5' upstream open reading frames (uORF) beginning at two highly conserved upstream initiation codons, AUG -41 and GUG -37, and terminating at two highly conserved stop codons, UGA +35 and UAA +15. The mutational analysis of these two 5' uORF revealed that each of them negatively regulates FLI-1 protein synthesis by precluding cap-dependent scanning to the 48- and 51-kDa AUG codons. Simultaneously, the translation termination of the two 5' uORF appears to enhance 48-kDa protein synthesis, by allowing downstream reinitiation at the 48-kDa AUG codon, and 51-kDa protein synthesis, by allowing scanning ribosomes to pile up and consequently allowing upstream initiation at the 51-kDa AUG codon. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a cellular mRNA displaying overlapping 5' uORF whose translation termination appears to be involved in the positive control of translation initiation at both downstream and upstream initiation codons.},

  abstract = {Mammalian target-of-rapamycin (mTOR) triggers S6 kinase (S6K) activation to phosphorylate targets linked to translation in response to energy, nutrients, and hormones. Pathways of TOR activation in plants remain unknown. Here, we uncover the role of the phytohormone auxin in TOR signalling activation and reinitiation after upstream open reading frame (uORF) translation, which in plants is dependent on translation initiation factor eIF3h. We show that auxin triggers TOR activation followed by S6K1 phosphorylation at T449 and efficient loading of uORF-mRNAs onto polysomes in a manner sensitive to the TOR inhibitor Torin-1. Torin-1 mediates recruitment of inactive S6K1 to polysomes, while auxin triggers S6K1 dissociation and recruitment of activated TOR instead. A putative target of TOR/S6K1-eIF3h-is phosphorylated and detected in polysomes in response to auxin. In TOR-deficient plants, polysomes were prebound by inactive S6K1, and loading of uORF-mRNAs and eIF3h was impaired. Transient expression of eIF3h-S178D in plant protoplasts specifically upregulates uORF-mRNA translation. We propose that TOR functions in polysomes to maintain the active S6K1 (and thus eIF3h) phosphorylation status that is critical for translation reinitiation.},

  abstract = {The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib (Velcade) effectively eradicates multiple myeloma (MM) cells, partly by activating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress apoptotic signaling. However, MM recurrences in bortezomib-treated patients are invariable. We have shown that ER stress signaling can also induce growth arrest and survival in cancer cells. Thus, we hypothesized that bortezomib therapy could induce quiescence and survival of residual MM cells, contributing to disease recurrence. Here, we report that in MM cells, proteasome inhibition with MG-132 or bortezomib results in a surviving cell fraction that enters a prolonged quiescent state (G0–G1 arrest). Mechanism analysis revealed that bortezomib-surviving quiescent cells attenuate eIF2α phosphorylation and induction of the ER stress proapoptotic gene GADD153. This occurs independently of the eIF2α upstream kinases PERK, GCN2, and PKR. In contrast, the prosurvival ER-chaperone BiP/Grp78 was persistently induced. The bortezomib-surviving quiescent fraction could be eradicated by a simultaneous or sequential combination therapy with salubrinal, an inhibitor of GADD34-PP1C phosphatase complex, and, in consequence, eIF2α dephosphorylation. This effect was mimicked by expression of a phosphorylated mimetic eIF2α-S51D mutant. Our data indicate that bortezomib can induce growth arrest in therapy-surviving MM cells and that attenuation of eIF2α phosphorylation contributes to this survival. Most importantly, this survival mechanism can be blocked by inhibiting eIF2α dephosphorylation. Thus, strategies that maintain eIF2α in a hyperphosphorylated state may be a novel therapeutic approach to maximize bortezomib-induced apoptosis and reduce residual disease and recurrences in this type of cancer.},

Analysis of partial variance (APV) is a technique that utilizes data obtained from controls run in the laboratory on the day of each assay to control for day to day variance statistically. The application of this technique to permit detection of otherwise obscured effects for both larger and smaller samples is exemplified utilizing data from two studies in which subjects were assessed on multiple different dates. These included a study of the association of depression with in vitro immune measures in 296 adolescents and a longitudinal study of 20 spouses of patients admitted to a cardiac intensive care unit studied together with 20 matched controls. APV was most useful in analyses of mitogen-induced lymphocyte proliferation assays, which had considerable day to day variability. In general, multivariate studies with functional immune measures may benefit most from application of this technique.},

It is uniquely poised to coordinate overall cell proliferation by its effects on both growth and division. A number of translation initiation factors are transcriptional targets of c-myc in a variety of assays. In particular, the mRNA cap-binding protein eIF4E has a myc-binding sequence in its promoter that is myc responsive in reporter assays and contains a high-affinity myc-binding site in chromosome immunoprecipitation experiments. Several differential expression screens have demonstrated altered levels of eIF4E, along with several other translation initiation factors, in response to alterations of c-myc levels. The potential for eIF4E and other translational control elements to mediate myc's transforming functions is particularly important because eIF4E is itself a known oncogenic factor. The ability of translation initiation factors to affect both cell division control and cell growth control coincides with myc's remarkable effects on both cell growth and cell division.},

  abstract = {The frequently altered phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of cellular processes required for breast carcinogenesis. The aim of the project was to develop a method to identify hotspot mutations in the PIK3CA gene in circulating tumor cells (CTCs) of metastatic breast cancer (metBC) patients. From 44 enrolled CTC-positive metBC patients a total number of 57 peripheral blood samples were analysed by CellSearch®. Genomic DNA of enriched CTCs was isolated, amplified and analyzed for PIK3CA mutations in exons 9 and 20 which lead to E542K, E545K or H1047R amino acid changes and result in increased PI3K activity. The mutations were detected by using SNaPshot-methodology comprising PCR amplification and single nucleotide primer extension. SNaPshot analysis was established using genomic DNA from different breast cancer cell lines and then successfully transferred to investigate blood samples and single cells. Overall, twelve hotspot mutations in either exon 9/E545K (6/12, 50\%) or exon 20/H1047R (6/12, 50\%) could be determined within 9 out of 57 (15.8\%) blood samples from 7 out of 44 (15.9\%) patients; CTC counts ranged from 1 to 9748. PIK3CA variants E542K, E545G and E545A were not detected. Analysing the PIK3CA genotype of CTCs has clinical relevance with respect to drug resistance, e.g. against HER2-targeted therapy. The herein described approach including SNaPshot technology provides a simple method to characterize hotspot mutations within CTCs enriched from peripheral blood and can be easily adopted for analysing further therapeutically relevant SNPs.},

Although it is one of the most fundamental processes of life, the entire cascade has never been quantified on a genome-wide scale. Here we simultaneously measured absolute mRNA and protein abundance and turnover by parallel metabolic pulse labelling for more than 5,000 genes in mammalian cells. Whereas mRNA and protein levels correlated better than previously thought, corresponding half-lives showed no correlation. Using a quantitative model we have obtained the first genome-scale prediction of synthesis rates of mRNAs and proteins. We find that the cellular abundance of proteins is predominantly controlled at the level of translation. Genes with similar combinations of mRNA and protein stability shared functional properties, indicating that half-lives evolved under energetic and dynamic constraints. Quantitative information about all stages of gene expression provides a rich resource and helps to provide a greater understanding of the underlying design principles.},

  abstract = {Gene expression during oocyte maturation, fertilization, and early embryo development until zygotic gene activation is regulated mainly by translational activation of maternally derived mRNAs. This process requires the presence of a poly(A)-binding protein. However, the cytoplasmic somatic cell poly(A)-binding protein (PABP1) is not expressed until later in embryogenesis. We recently identified an embryonic poly(A)-binding protein (ePAB) in Xenopus. ePAB is the predominant cytoplasmic PABP in Xenopus oocytes and early embryos and prevents deadenylation of mRNAs, suggesting its importance in the regulation of gene expression during early Xenopus development. Here we report the identification of the mouse ortholog of Xenopus ePAB. The mouse ePAB gene on chromosome 2 contains 14 exons that specify an alternatively spliced mRNA encoding a protein of 608 or 561 aa with ≈65\% identity to Xenopus ePAB. Mouse ePAB mRNA is expressed in ovaries and testis but not in somatic tissues. In situ hybridization localizes ePAB RNA to oocytes and confirms its absence from surrounding somatic cells in the mouse ovary. During early development, mouse ePAB is expressed in prophase I and metaphase II oocytes and one-cell and two-cell embryos and then becomes undetectable in four-or-more-cell embryos. In contrast, PABP1 mRNA expression is minimal in oocytes and early embryos until the eight-cell stage when it increases, becoming predominant at the blastocyst stage. The expression of mouse ePAB before zygotic gene activation argues for its importance in translational activation of maternally derived mRNAs during mammalian oocyte and early preimplantation embryo development.},

Here we show that the eIF4A RNA helicase is required for translation of key KRAS signaling molecules and that pharmacological inhibition of eIF4A has single-agent activity against murine and human PDAC models at safe dose levels. EIF4A was uniquely required for the translation of mRNAs with long and highly structured 5'UTRs including those with multiple G-quadruplex (GQ) elements. Computational analyses identified these features in mRNAs encoding KRAS and key downstream molecules. Transcriptome-scale ribosome footprinting accurately identified eIF4A-dependent mRNAs in PDAC including critical KRAS signaling molecules such as PI3K, RALA, RAC2, MET, MYC, and YAP1. These findings contrast with a recent study that relied on an older method, polysome fractionation, and implicated redox-related genes as eIF4A clients. Together, our findings highlight the power of ribosome footprinting in conjunction with deep RNA sequencing in accurately decoding translational control mechanisms and define the therapeutic mechanism of eIF4A inhibitors in PDAC.},

Recent genome-wide ribosome profiling studies suggest that thousands of uORFs initiate with non-AUG start codons. Although intriguing, these non-AUG uORF predictions have been made without statistical control or validation; thus, the importance of these elements remains to be demonstrated. To address this, we took a comparative genomics approach to study AUG and non-AUG uORFs. We mapped transcription leaders in multiple Saccharomyces yeast species and applied a novel machine learning algorithm (uORF-seqr) to ribosome profiling data to identify statistically significant uORFs. We found that AUG and non-AUG uORFs are both frequently found in Saccharomyces yeasts. Although most non-AUG uORFs are found in only one species, hundreds have either conserved sequence or position within Saccharomyces. uORFs initiating with UUG are particularly common and are shared between species at rates similar to that of AUG uORFs. However, non-AUG uORFs are translated less efficiently than AUG-uORFs and are less subject to removal via alternative transcription initiation under normal growth conditions. These results suggest that a subset of non-AUG uORFs may play important roles in regulating gene expression.},

  abstract = {The product of the yeast SUP45 gene (Sup45p) is highly homologous to the Xenopus eukaryote release factor 1 (eRF1), which has release factor activity in vitro. We show, using the two-hybrid system, that in Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sup45p and the product of the SUP35 gene (Sup35p) interact in vivo. The ability of Sup45p C-terminally tagged with (His)6 to specifically precipitate Sup35p from a cell lysate was used to confirm this interaction in vitro. Although overexpression of either the SUP45 or SUP35 genes alone did not reduce the efficiency of codon-specific tRNA nonsense suppression, the simultaneous overexpression of both the SUP35 and SUP45 genes in nonsense suppressor tRNA-containing strains produced an antisuppressor phenotype. These data are consistent with Sup35p and Sup45p forming a complex with release factor properties. Furthermore, overexpression of either Xenopus or human eRF1 (SUP45) genes also resulted in anti-suppression only if that strain was also overexpressing the yeast SUP35 gene. Antisuppression is a characteristic phenotype associated with overexpression of both prokaryote and mitochondrial release factors. We propose that Sup45p and Sup35p interact to form a release factor complex in yeast and that Sup35p, which has GTP binding sequence motifs in its C-terminal domain, provides the GTP hydrolytic activity which is a demonstrated requirement of the eukaryote translation termination reaction.},

Here, we develop a method for inferring translation elongation kinetics from ribosome profiling data using recent advances in mathematical modelling of mRNA translation. Our method distinguishes between the elongation rate intrinsic to the ribosome’s stepping cycle and the actual elongation rate that takes into account ribosome interference. This distinction allows us to quantify the extent of ribosomal collisions along the transcript and identify individual codons where ribosomal collisions are likely. When examining ribosome profiling in yeast, we observe that translation initiation and elongation are close to their optima and traffic is minimized at the beginning of the transcript to favour ribosome recruitment. However, we find many individual sites of congestion along the mRNAs where the probability of ribosome interference can reach \$50\textbackslash\%\$. Our work provides new measures of translation initiation and elongation efficiencies, emphasizing the importance of rating these two stages of translation separately.},

Four eIF2α kinases, namely heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI), protein kinase R (PKR), PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase, (PERK) and general control non-depressible 2 (GCN2), have been identified thus far, and they are known to be activated by heme depletion, viral infection, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and amino acid starvation, respectively. Because eIF2α is phosphorylated under various stress conditions, the existence of an additional eIF2α kinase has been suggested. To validate the existence of the unidentified eIF2α kinase, we constructed an eIF2α kinase quadruple knockout cells (4KO cells) in which the four known eIF2α kinase genes were deleted using the CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing. Phosphorylation of eIF2α was completely abolished in the 4KO cells by various stress stimulations. Our data suggests that the four known eIF2α kinases are sufficient for ISR and that there are no additional eIF2α kinases in vertebrates.},

Although mTOR globally promotes translation by regulating the mRNA 5' cap-binding protein eIF4E (eukaryotic initiation factor 4E), it also preferentially regulates the translation of certain classes of mRNA via unclear mechanisms. To help fill this gap in knowledge, we performed a quantitative proteomic screen to identify proteins that associate with the mRNA 5' cap in an mTOR-dependent manner. Using this approach, we identified many potential regulatory factors, including the putative RNA-binding protein LARP1 (La-related protein 1). Our results indicate that LARP1 associates with actively translating ribosomes via PABP and that LARP1 stimulates the translation of mRNAs containing a 5' terminal oligopyrimidine (TOP) motif, encoding for components of the translational machinery. We found that LARP1 associates with the mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and is required for global protein synthesis as well as cell growth and proliferation. Together, these data reveal important molecular mechanisms involved in TOP mRNA translation and implicate LARP1 as an important regulator of cell growth and proliferation.},

  abstract = {Summary: High-throughput technologies have led to an explosion of genomic data available for automated analysis. The consequent possibility to simultaneously sample multiple layers of variation along the gene expression flow requires computational methods integrating raw information from different ‘-omics’. It has been recently demonstrated that translational control is a widespread phenomenon, with profound and still underestimated regulation capabilities. Although detecting changes in the levels of total messenger RNAs (mRNAs; the transcriptome), of polysomally loaded mRNAs (the translatome) and of proteins (the proteome) is experimentally feasible in a high-throughput way, the integration of these levels is still far from being robustly approached. Here we introduce tRanslatome, a new R/Bioconductor package, which is a complete platform for the simultaneous pairwise analysis of transcriptome, translatome and proteome data. The package includes most of the available statistical methods developed for the analysis of high-throughput data, allowing the parallel comparison of differentially expressed genes and the corresponding differentially enriched biological themes. Notably, it also enables the prediction of translational regulatory elements on mRNA sequences. The utility of this tool is demonstrated with two case studies., Availability and implementation: tRanslatome is available in Bioconductor., Contact: t.tebaldi@unitn.it, Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Here we show that the X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP) IRES operates in an evolutionary conserved viral like mode and the structural integrity, particularly in the vicinity of AUG, is critical for ribosome recruitment. The binding of eIF3 together with PABP potentiates ribosome recruitment to the IRES. Our data support the model in which eIF3 binds directly to the XIAP IRES RNA in a structure-dependent manner and acts as a scaffold for IRES RNA, PABP and the 40S ribosome.},

In this study, we have analyzed the level of miR-10b and cell motility and invasiveness in several human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell lines. Our results reveal a significant correlation of miR-10b level with cell motility and invasiveness. Overexpression of miR-10b in KYSE140 cells increased cell motility and invasiveness, whereas inhibition of miR-10b in EC9706 cells reduced cell invasiveness, although it did not alter cell motility. Additionally, we identified KLF4, a known tumor suppressor gene that has been reported to suppress esophageal cancer cell migration and invasion, as a direct target of miR-10b. Furthermore, overexpression of miR-10b in KYSE140 and KYSE450 cells led to a reduction of endogenous KLF4 protein, whereas silencing of miR-10b in EC9706 cells caused up-regulation of KLF4 protein. Coexpression of miR-10b and KLF4 in KYSE140 cells and coexpression of small interfering RNA for KLF4 mRNA and miR-10b-AS in EC9706 cells partially abrogated the effect of miR-10b on cell migration and invasion. Finally, analyses of the miR-10b level in 40 human esophageal cancer samples and their paired normal adjacent tissues revealed an elevated expression of miR-10b in 95\% (38 of 40) of cancer tissues, although no significant correlation of the miR-10b level with clinical metastasis status was observed in these samples.},

Translation and energy metabolism play important roles in homeostatic cell growth and proliferation, and when dysregulated lead to cancer. eIF4E is a key regulator of translation, which promotes oncogenesis by selectively enhancing translation of a subset of tumor-promoting mRNAs (e.g., cyclins and c-myc). PI3K/AKT and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, which are strongly implicated in cancer etiology, exert a number of their biological effects by modulating translation. The PI3K/AKT pathway regulates eIF4E function by inactivating the inhibitory 4E-BPs via mTORC1, whereas MAPKs activate MAP kinase signal-integrating kinases 1 and 2, which phosphorylate eIF4E. In addition, AMP-activated protein kinase, which is a central sensor of the cellular energy balance, impairs translation by inhibiting mTORC1. Thus, eIF4E plays a major role in mediating the effects of PI3K/AKT, MAPK, and cellular energetics on mRNA translation.},

  abstract = {Obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes are associated with cancer‐related mortality. We assessed whether hyperinsulinemia is a risk factor for cancer death in nonobese people without diabetes. We conducted a prospective cohort study using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999–2010 and followed up the participants until December 31, 2011. For the primary analysis of cancer mortality, we used Cox proportional hazard models to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) in the participants with hyperinsulinemia and those without. Hyperinsulinemia was defined as a fasting insulin level of ≥10 μU/mL. To identify causes of deaths, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision codes were used. This study included 9,778 participants aged 20 years or older without diabetes or a history of cancer: 6,718 nonobese participants (2,057 with hyperinsulinemia [30.6\%]) and 3,060 obese participants (2,303 with hyperinsulinemia [75.3\%]). A total of 99.9\% completed follow‐up. Among all study participants, cancer mortality was significantly higher in those with hyperinsulinemia than in those without hyperinsulinemia (adjusted HR 2.04, 95\% CI 1.24–3.34, p\,=\,0.005). Similarly, among nonobese participants, multivariable analysis showed that cancer mortality was significantly higher in those with hyperinsulinemia than in those without (adjusted HR 1.89, 95\% CI 1.07–3.35, p\,=\,0.02). Considering that nonobese people with hyperinsulinemia were at higher risk of cancer mortality than those without hyperinsulinemia, improvement of hyperinsulinemia may be an important approach for preventing cancer regardless of the presence or absence of obesity.,  What's new? , Obesity, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes are associated with cancer‐related mortality, with hyperinsulinemia possibly playing a role. However, hyperinsulinemia also occurs in nonobese people. So far, no study has investigated whether hyperinsulinemia in nonobese people without diabetes is associated with increased risks of cancer‐related death. This prospective cohort study shows that among nonobese people, hyperinsulinemia was associated with a significantly higher risk of cancer mortality. Furthermore, hyperinsulinemia was associated with an increased risk of cancer death in people with normal fasting plasma glucose levels. Improvement of hyperinsulinemia may thus be an important approach for preventing cancer regardless of obesity.},

  abstract = {Fragile X syndrome (FXS), the most common cause of inherited mental retardation and autism, is caused by transcriptional silencing of FMR1, which encodes the translational repressor fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). FMRP and cytoplasmic polyadenylation element-binding protein (CPEB), an activator of translation, are present in neuronal dendrites, are predicted to bind many of the same mRNAs and may mediate a translational homeostasis that, when imbalanced, results in FXS. Consistent with this possibility, Fmr1(-/y); Cpeb1(-/-) double-knockout mice displayed amelioration of biochemical, morphological, electrophysiological and behavioral phenotypes associated with FXS. Acute depletion of CPEB1 in the hippocampus of adult Fmr1(-/y) mice rescued working memory deficits, demonstrating reversal of this FXS phenotype. Finally, we find that FMRP and CPEB1 balance translation at the level of polypeptide elongation. Our results suggest that disruption of translational homeostasis is causal for FXS and that the maintenance of this homeostasis by FMRP and CPEB1 is necessary for normal neurologic function.},

  abstract = {Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a rare bone marrow failure disorder that affects 7 out of 1,000,000 live births and has been associated with mutations in components of the ribosome. In order to characterize the genetic landscape of this heterogeneous disorder, we recruited a cohort of 472 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of DBA and performed whole-exome sequencing (WES). We identified relevant rare and predicted damaging mutations for 78\% of individuals. The majority of mutations were singletons, absent from population databases, predicted to cause loss of function, and located in 1 of 19 previously reported ribosomal protein (RP)-encoding genes. Using exon coverage estimates, we identified and validated 31 deletions in RP genes. We also observed an enrichment for extended splice site mutations and validated their diverse effects using RNA sequencing in cell lines obtained from individuals with DBA. Leveraging the size of our cohort, we observed robust genotype-phenotype associations with congenital abnormalities and treatment outcomes. We further identified rare mutations in seven previously unreported RP genes that may cause DBA, as well as several distinct disorders that appear to phenocopy DBA, including nine individuals with biallelic CECR1 mutations that result in deficiency of ADA2. However, no new genes were identified at exome-wide significance, suggesting that there are no unidentified genes containing mutations readily identified by WES that explain {$>$}5\% of DBA-affected case subjects. Overall, this report should inform not only clinical practice for DBA-affected individuals, but also the design and analysis of rare variant studies for heterogeneous Mendelian disorders.},

  abstract = {Discovered in 1993, micoRNAs (miRNAs) are now recognized as one of the major regulatory gene families in eukaryotes. To date, 24521 microRNAs have been discovered and there are certainly more to come. It was primarily acknowledged that miRNAs result in gene expression repression at both the level of mRNA stability by conducting mRNA degradation and the level of translation (at initiation and after initiation) by inhibiting protein translation or degrading the polypeptides through binding complementarily to 3′UTR of the target mRNAs. Nevertheless, some studies revealed that miRNAs have the capability of activating gene expression directly or indirectly in respond to different cell types and conditions and in the presence of distinct cofactors. This reversibility in their posttranslational gene regulatory natures enables the bearing cells to rapidly response to different cell conditions and consequently block unnecessary energy wastage or maintain the cell state. This paper provides an overview of the current understandings of the miRNA characteristics including their genes and biogenesis, as well as their mediated downregulation. We also review up-to-date knowledge of miRNA-mediated gene upregulation through highlighting some notable examples and discuss the emerging concepts of their associations with other posttranscriptional gene regulation processes.},

In order to develop effective and lasting therapies, it is essential to understand the source of this heterogeneity, and its role in tumor progression and therapy resistance. Here, we consider not only genetic and epigenetic mechanisms, but also inflammation and cell state reprogramming in creating tumor heterogeneity. We discuss similarities between normal mammary epithelial developmental states and various breast cancer molecular sub-types, and the cells that are thought to propagate them. We emphasize that while stem cell phenotypes and mesenchymal character have often been conflated, existing data suggest that the combination of intrinsic genetic and epigenetic changes, and microenvironmental influences generate multiple types of tumor propagating cells distinguishable by their positions along a continuum of epithelial to mesenchymal, stem to differentiated and embryonic to mature cell states. Consequently, in addition to the prospect of stem cell-directed tumor therapies, there is a need to understand interrelationships between stem cell, epithelial-mesenchymal, and tumor-associated reprogramming events to develop new therapies that mitigate cell state plasticity and minimize the evolution of tumor heterogeneity.},

  abstract = {Elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2k) phosphorylates and inactivates eEF2. Insulin induces dephosphorylation of eEF2 and inactivation of eEF2 kinase, and these effects are blocked by rapamycin, which inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin, mTOR. However, the signalling mechanisms underlying these effects are unknown. Regulation of eEF2 phosphorylation and eEF2k activity is lost in cells in which phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) has been genetically knocked out. This is not due to loss of mTOR function since phosphorylation of another target of mTOR, initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1, is not defective. PDK1 is required for activation of members of the AGC kinase family; we show that two such kinases, p70 S6 kinase (regulated via mTOR) and p90(RSK1) (activated by Erk), phosphorylate eEF2k at a conserved serine and inhibit its activity. In response to insulin-like growth factor 1, which activates p70 S6 kinase but not Erk, regulation of eEF2 is blocked by rapamycin. In contrast, regulation of eEF2 by stimuli that activate Erk is insensitive to rapamycin, but blocked by inhibitors of MEK/Erk signalling, consistent with the involvement of p90(RSK1).},

METHODS: Western blotting was performed to quantify the elF4E protein expression in the normal human liver cell line L02 and the hepatoma cell lines Hep3B, HepG2, and Huh7. Forty-six hepatocellular carcinoma samples with complete clinical data were obtained from Changzheng Hospital during the period of December 2008 to July 2009. The expression of eIF4E in the tumor samples and their adjacent tissues were detected by immunohistochemistry. The relationship between the test results and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) prognosis was statistically analysed by using a COX proportional hazard model. RESULTS: Western blotting analysis showed that there were distinct eIF4E protein bands in all three of the hepatoma cell lines. In particular, the HepG2 cell line had the highest level of eIF4E protein expression. The L02 cell group had a low eIF4E expression. Immunohistochemical assay showed that there were 32 cases in which the tumour tissue expression was higher than their adjacent tissues, accounting for 69.57\%. There were also 14 cases in which the tumour tissue expression was lower or no significant difference was found, accounting for 30.43\%. COX proportional hazards model analysis showed that HCC prognosis was related to the depth of invasion, the overexpression of eIF4E and p53, possibly as independent HCC prognostic predictors. CONCLUSION: In summary, eIF4E expression is associated with liver cancer, and patients with high eIF4E expression levels have a higher risk of recurrence.},

Here we report an analysis of the co-evolution of translatomes and transcriptomes using ribosome-profiling and matched RNA-sequencing data for three organs (brain, liver and testis) in five mammals (human, macaque, mouse, opossum and platypus) and a bird (chicken). Our within-species analyses reveal that translational regulation is widespread in the different organs, in particular across the spermatogenic cell types of the testis. The between-species divergence in gene expression is around 20\% lower at the translatome layer than at the transcriptome layer owing to extensive buffering between the expression layers, which especially preserved old, essential and housekeeping genes. Translational upregulation specifically counterbalanced global dosage reductions during the evolution of sex chromosomes and the effects of meiotic sex-chromosome inactivation during spermatogenesis. Despite the overall prevalence of buffering, some genes evolved faster at the translatome layer—potentially indicating adaptive changes in expression; testis tissue shows the highest fraction of such genes. Further analyses incorporating mass spectrometry proteomics data establish that the co-evolution of transcriptomes and translatomes is reflected at the proteome layer. Together, our work uncovers co-evolutionary patterns and associated selective forces across the expression layers, and provides a resource for understanding their interplay in mammalian organs.},

The intimate relationship between mRNA decay and translation is further indicated by the ability of translation-initiation factors and proteins that bind the poly(A) tail to protect the mRNA from degradation. Moreover, evidence shows that inhibiting translation elongation promotes mRNA stabilization The turnover of mRNAs is also regulated by cis-acting elements that either promote or inhibit their decay. The most prevalent is the A+U-rich element (ARE), found in the 3′untranslated region (3′ UTR) of mRNAs encoding many important growth control proteins. ARE-binding proteins affect mRNA stability, translation and subcellular localization. Other elements found in the 5′ UTR and coding regions also modulate transcript stability. Several signalling pathways are implicated in triggering changes in stability of specific mRNAs. One example is the interleukin-2 mRNA, which is stabilized by the c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK) signalling pathway through JNK-responsive elements in its 5′UTR. A strong link between translation and RNA turnover is also shown by nonsense-mediated decay, which ensures that mRNAs containing premature stop codons are degraded.},

  abstract = {The translational control of oncoprotein expression is implicated in many cancers. Here we report an eIF4A RNA helicase-dependent mechanism of translational control that contributes to oncogenesis and underlies the anticancer effects of silvestrol and related compounds. For example, eIF4A promotes T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukaemia development in vivo and is required for leukaemia maintenance. Accordingly, inhibition of eIF4A with silvestrol has powerful therapeutic effects against murine and human leukaemic cells in vitro and in vivo. We use transcriptome-scale ribosome footprinting to identify the hallmarks of eIF4A-dependent transcripts. These include 5′ untranslated region (UTR) sequences such as the 12-nucleotide guanine quartet (CGG)4 motif that can form RNA G-quadruplex structures. Notably, among the most eIF4A-dependent and silvestrol-sensitive transcripts are a number of oncogenes, superenhancer-associated transcription factors, and epigenetic regulators. Hence, the 5′~UTRs of select cancer genes harbour a targetable requirement for the eIF4A RNA helicase.},

Unfortunately expense and limited specimen availability often lead to studies with small sample sizes. This makes accurate estimation of variability difficult, since variance estimates made on a gene by gene basis will have few degrees of freedom, and the assumption that all genes share equal variance is unlikely to be true. RESULTS: We propose a model by which the within gene variances are drawn from an inverse gamma distribution, whose parameters are estimated across all genes. This results in a test statistic that is a minor variation of those used in standard linear models. We demonstrate that the model assumptions are valid on experimental data, and that the model has more power than standard tests to pick up large changes in expression, while not increasing the rate of false positives.

  abstract = {l-Glutamine is a nutritionally semi-essential amino acid for proper growth in most cells and tissues, and plays an important role in the determination and guarding of the normal metabolic processes of the cells. With the help of transport systems, extracellular l-glutamine crosses the plasma membrane and is converted into alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) through two pathways, namely, the glutaminase (GLS) I and II pathway. Reversely, AKG can be converted into glutamine by glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and glutamine synthetase (GS), or be converted into CO2 via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and provide energy for the cells. Different steps of glutamine metabolism (the glutamine-AKG axis) are regulated by several factors, rendering the glutamine-AKG axis a potential target to counteract cancer. Moreover, intracellular glutamine plays an important role in cellular homeostasis not only as a precursor for protein synthesis, but also for its nutritional roles in cell growth, lipid metabolism, insulin secretion, and so on. The main objective of this review is to highlight the metabolic pathways of glutamine to AKG, with special emphasis on nutritional and therapeutic use of glutamine-AKG axis to improve the health and well-being of animals and humans.},

Applied on simulated and real datasets, Xtail exhibits high sensitivity with minimal false-positive rates, outperforming existing methods in the accuracy of quantifying differential translations. With published ribosome profiling datasets, Xtail does not only reveal differentially translated genes that make biological sense, but also uncovers new events of differential translation in human cancer cells on mTOR signalling perturbation and in human primary macrophages on interferon gamma (IFN-γ) treatment. This demonstrates the value of Xtail in providing novel insights into the molecular mechanisms that involve translational dysregulations.},

Thus, we performed a comprehensive detection of terminal oligo-pyrimidine (TOP), which is one of the well-characterized cis-regulatory motifs for translational controls located immediately downstream of the transcriptional start sites of mRNAs. Utilizing our precise 5'-end information of the full-length cDNAs, we could screen 1645 candidate TOP genes by position specific matrix search. Among them, not only 75 out of 78 ribosomal protein genes but also eight previously identified non-ribosomal-protein TOP genes were included. We further experimentally validated the translational activities of 83 TOP candidate genes. Clear translational regulations exerted on the stimulation of 12-O-tetradecanoyl-1-phorbol-13-acetate for at least 41 of them was observed, indicating that there should be a few hundreds of human genes which are subjected to regulation at translation levels via TOPs. Our result suggests that TOP genes code not only formerly characterized ribosomal proteins and translation-related proteins but also a wider variety of proteins, such as lysosome-related proteins and metabolism-related proteins, playing pivotal roles in gene expression controls in the majority of cellular mRNAs.},

A yeast two-hybrid analysis revealed that Pdcd4 associates with the eukaryotic translation initiation factors eIF4AI and eIF4AII. Immunofluorescent confocal microscopy showed that Pdcd4 colocalizes with eIF4A in the cytoplasm. eIF4A is an ATP-dependent RNA helicase needed to unwind 5' mRNA secondary structure. Recombinant Pdcd4 specifically inhibited the helicase activity of eIF4A and eIF4F. In vivo translation assays showed that Pdcd4 inhibited cap-dependent but not internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-dependent translation. In contrast, Pdcd4(D418A), a mutant inactivated for binding to eIF4A, failed to inhibit cap-dependent or IRES-dependent translation or AP-1 transactivation. Recombinant Pdcd4 prevented eIF4A from binding to the C-terminal region of eIF4G (amino acids 1040 to 1560) but not to the middle region of eIF4G(amino acids 635 to 1039). In addition, both Pdcd4 and Pdcd4(D418A) bound to the middle region of eIF4G. The mechanism by which Pdcd4 inhibits translation thus appears to involve inhibition of eIF4A helicase, interference with eIF4A association-dissociation from eIF4G, and inhibition of eIF4A binding to the C-terminal domain of eIF4G. Pdcd4 binding to eIF4A is linked to its transformation-suppressing activity, as Pdcd4-eIF4A binding and consequent inhibition of translation are required for Pdcd4 transrepression of AP-1.},

Cancer cells are characterized by wholesale changes in long-range gene interactions, but the role that these long-range interactions play in cancer progression and metastasis is not well understood. In this study, we used IGFBP3, a gene involved in breast cancer pathogenesis, as bait in a 4C-seq experiment comparing normal breast cells (HMEC) with two breast cancer cell lines (MCF7, an ER positive cell line, and MDA-MB-231, a triple negative cell line). The IGFBP3 long-range interaction profile was substantially altered in breast cancer. Many interactions seen in normal breast cells are lost and novel interactions appear in cancer lines. We found that in HMEC, the breast carcinoma amplified sequence gene family (BCAS) 1–4 were among the top 10 most significantly enriched regions of interaction with IGFBP3. 3D-FISH analysis indicated that the translocation-prone BCAS genes, which are located on chromosomes 1, 17, and 20, are in close physical proximity with IGFBP3 and each other in normal breast cells. We also found that epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a gene implicated in tumorigenesis, interacts significantly with IGFBP3 and that this interaction may play a role in their regulation. Breakpoint analysis suggests that when an IGFBP3 interacting region undergoes a translocation an additional interaction detectable by 4C is gained. Overall, our data from multiple lines of evidence suggest an important role for long-range chromosomal interactions in the pathogenesis of cancer.},

We find that overexpression of tRNAs recognizing codons with a low observed-over-expected ratio may overcome the translational bottleneck in tumorigenesis. We further observed overall overexpression and amplification of tRNA modification enzymes, aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and translation factors, which may play synergistic roles with overexpression of tRNAs to activate the translational systems across multiple cancer types.},

It is therefore critical to effectively address batch effects in genomic data to overcome these challenges. Many existing methods for batch effects adjustment assume the data follow a continuous, bell-shaped Gaussian distribution. However in RNA-seq studies the data are typically skewed, over-dispersed counts, so this assumption is not appropriate and may lead to erroneous results. Negative binomial regression models have been used previously to better capture the properties of counts. We developed a batch correction method, ComBat-seq, using a negative binomial regression model that retains the integer nature of count data in RNA-seq studies, making the batch adjusted data compatible with common differential expression software packages that require integer counts. We show in realistic simulations that the ComBat-seq adjusted data results in better statistical power and control of false positives in differential expression compared to data adjusted by the other available methods. We further demonstrated in a real data example that ComBat-seq successfully removes batch effects and recovers the biological signal in the data.},

We found accumulations at AAA, CAA, and GAA codons, suggesting that translation is slow when these codons are in the ribosomal A site, but these changes appeared too small to affect protein output. Instead, we observed activation of the GCN4-mediated stress response by a non-canonical pathway. Thus, loss of mcm5s2U causes global effects on gene expression due to perturbation of cellular signaling.},

  abstract = {Adenovirus dodecahedron (Dd), a nanoparticulate proteinaceous biodegradable virus-like particle (VLP), was used as a vector for delivery of an oncogene inhibitor to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) rat orthotopic model. Initiation factor eIF4E is an oncogene with elevated expression in human cancers. Cell-impermeant eIF4E inhibitor, cap structure analog (cap) and anti-cancer antibiotic doxorubicin (Dox) were delivered as Dd conjugates. Dd-cap and Dd-dox inhibited cancer cell culture proliferation up to 50 and 84\%, respectively, while with free Dox similar results could be obtained only at a 5 times higher concentration. In animal HCC model the combination treatment of Dd-cap/Dd-dox caused 40\% inhibition of tumor growth. Importantly, the level of two pro-oncogenes, eIF4E and c-myc, was significantly diminished in tumor sections of treated rats. Attachment to Dd, a virus-like particle, permitted the first demonstration of cap analog intracellular delivery and resulted in improved doxorubicin delivery leading to statistically significant inhibition of HCC tumor growth.},
